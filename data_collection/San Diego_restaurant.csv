Good place to get your tacos.  Grab and go.

FOOD
This is what I tried:

Carne Asada Taco
Baja Taco
Surf and Turf Taco

Tacos were good, sauce is where you got the extra “kick” you were looking for.  I recommend playing around...with all of them to see what is your flavor.

There are two spaces-ish out front.  You are better parking off on the street and just walking over.

My uncle even has a piece of metal he'll give to a butcher in the thickness of how he wants his meat cut....I went to the Taco Stand on B street with a co- worker and we were blown away by their carne asada and pork tacos.

Overall, the offerings were varied, the prices were fantastic, the atmosphere was comfortable, but some of the tacos lacked oomph.

davidmlowe,20.0,"Being alone awaiting my flight home the following day I didn't really fancy a full restaurant experience as it's just not the same on your own. That's why I opted for a more informal burger style place, like most where you order at the counter,...unlike most fast foods they give you a number a bring to your table. The menu was a little confusing but I managed to work it out, however when I asked for the mix of onion rings and fries I just ended up with fries. When it was brought out and placed in front of me I said ""I asked for both onion rings and fries?"" The server just pointed at my receipt and said ""it says just fries on there"" which wasn't helpful. I was also surprised that I wasn't asked what size burger I wanted because there are two options I suppose being in a foreign country I didn't ask as felt bit silly. I wouldn't mind but I bunged then a couple dollars tip in their tip jar on the counter which considering they are offering table service was more than enough. I'd say it was t any better than a bog standard fast food jointMore",November 2019,Burger Lounge

This...In-N-Out is conveniently off I-5 Hwy at Balboa Exit.  Fortunately, it is located on Damon Ave (off Mission Bay Drive).  The line is frequently down Damon Ave and would be stopping traffic on Misson Bay Drive.

cogreeneyz,30.0,"We came here for dinner one night since we don’t have In-N-Out where we live and never pass up the opportunity to eat there at least once whenever visiting a city that has the chain. 

First of all, this place was PACKED.  The line of...cars in the drive-thru was at least 20 cars long, so we went inside. Since it was so busy, we took our food back to the hotel room (5 min away) and ate there. 

I have to say, I didn’t expect the food to be as hot as it would have been if we had eaten at the restaurant but I was pretty disappointed by the lack of “freshness”. The bun on my burger seemed stale and the fries were already cold and seemed flavorless.  I wasn’t impressed and we didn’t eat there again after that one visit.

dwfr,30.0,"A few years ago we were in NYC and saw a huge line for Shake Shack at Grand Central Station. We thought it must be something special, but not wanting to wait in line, we didn't try one until they came to San Diego.

We...recently had our chance to try it at Westfield UTC mall where we stopped by for an early (11:30am) lunch -- no lines! 

As I'd half suspected, it's one of those vastly overrated things. The coffee flavored shake was delicious, but the burger was very average -- I was expecting Angus style, big and meaty, a good sesame bun and stacked high with condiments. Nope. Small and wimpy and a little too pink in the middle. Spongy bun. The crinkle cut fries were good -- better than In-n-Out fries which taste like cardboard to me. Two wimpy cheeseburgers, one shared fry serving and one shared shake was just over $21. 

Service was OK, nothing outstanding. The establishment is nice and new and modern with indoor and outdoor seating. It's tucked down a side alley of the mall, so it's not that obvious where it is. 

We both said we wouldn't bother to go back as we can get a better burger elsewhere.

Neither the burger or the mushroom in the Shack Stack had much flavor to them. Come to think of it, I don't think my burger had any Shack sauce. The fries were good and chocolate shake was fine.

As we were waiting, many local folks be it military or close business people popped in for a quick take out.  That really made us feel better about stopping.  Then the food came.  I would have to see the menu to remember what all we ordered but it was delicious.  I know we tried beef, chicken and pork to get variety.

nnviekie,30.0,"Note: I am not a big fan of donuts and I think all donuts taste the same so my review might reflect that. Just a fair warning.
I was here on July 13, 2017 at around 21:50 (9:50pm) 10 minutes before their front closes. I...believe their drive-thru opens 24 hours though. We saw several people who tried to come in after the doors were closed though so I thought it was funny. It was probably because we were eating outside the tables next to the drive thru entrance or they saw our car parked in the front. Anyways, we came in and ordered a dozen donuts after our dinner. The person in the counter was nice to get our donuts and I also ordered a drink here since I was thirsty. I split the donuts with 3 of my friends. Since they were closing, we decided to sit outside.
The donuts were okay. I liked some of them, but they all taste the same to me. I know and hear that Krispy Kreme makes good donuts though and I tried other shops. I can taste some difference between a chocolate and few other sweets, but the after taste to me is all just sweet. Even the cheesecake taste the same as regular donuts, but a bit sweeter. I am not that amazed at donuts like many other people who are. Maybe it is because I used to eat everyday and there are always free donuts that I get sick of it. Or because donuts are too sweet for me. But I can say that when I ate the donuts here that it is great for those that love donuts. So it is not bad, but not the best. I also can say that the time we had the donuts, it was not as fresh since we did come near closing time, but still edible. One of my friends thought it was too sweet too, but my other friend liked it.
TL;DR: The donuts here taste average to me. Maybe we came at a bad time, but it is passable. It was a bit too sweet for me though. If you haven't had Krispy Kremes you are not missing much, but at the same time if you are in the area and like donuts this might be the place for you.More",July 2017,Krispy Kreme

La Playa is a typical local joint with a few tables on the sidewalk, a few more inside and a small covered patio.
The star here is the really great food. You’ll also...appreciate the reasonable prices and quick service. 
In the land of tacos and burritos, La Playa is stand out. Super tasty asada tacos. But yummy tacos all around. Mr. prefers their fish tacos. The tortillas are soft and fragrant and filled generously with tasty bits. 
I soooo love their beans and rice. In my opinion it’s pretty hard to find something prepared exactly I how I like them from my desert rat days. Runny with a few errant smushed beans and a light snowing of Cotija cheese. Perfect. 
Love their Agua de Jamaica too. Not too sweet and just right. I like the fact my meal shows up on a real plate with cutlery instead of disposable plates and forks.

So if you’re going to EAT some food, quickly, and would like it to taste pretty good, this is the place. Don’t expect much more than that.

And trust me on this one, this place is as legit as it comes. I think a lot of...these people who wrote these negative reviews are going to these fancy, newfangled types of ""modern taco joints."" These sorts of places are crap. This place here on Mission is awesome. First of all, do not expect anything fancy. This is a hole-in-the-wall kind of place. My wife and I had the shrimp and fish tacos. Although the shrimp tacos had a little bit too much rice for my liking, they were still very good. The fish tacos were the bomb. It was the perfect amount fried fish, cabbage and tomato. The dressing they put on it was not overly done.

gypsyuno,20.0,"We had lunch at the Rubio’s Coastal Grill in North La Jolla.  For those not familiar Rubio’s is a fast food chain specializing in fish tacos and similar fare.  Lots of outlets in the San Diego area and a few elsewhere.  Order at the counter...and they bring your food to the table.  Help yourself to condiments.  We were very disappointed in the fish tacos.  My wife had the original version, I had the same with guacamole and some other adds.  Tasteless.  Condiment area was not clean, and the whole seating area looked like it hadn’t been cleaned up since morning.  You can get better fish tacos just about anywhere.More",July 2019,Rubio's Coastal Grill

My cousin was patient and kind to wait for me but his food got cold.  The taco's were good, but the wait time was completely unacceptable and, unless they are raising the shrimp prior to cooking, need to speed it up.

When I asked the server she came back with my meal and apologized for...not bringing it out, that it had been ready and waiting for some time.  Meal was cold (taco trio-cold fish, cold rice, lukewarm beans)..she offered to have a new meal cooked; but this was a fast meal for us.   I just wanted to eat and get on with our day. My partner’s food was cold too; he mentioned “mine too” to the food server. I was disappointed that she didn’t offer to comp the meal or even invite me back for the next meal on the house or even send the manager  by to say anything. The small gesture of comping the  meal or inviting us back for a better experience.  It’s the smallest gesture in situations like this to get a customer to come back. I also didn’t want to ask for the manager as it would have ruined our enjoying each other’s company, if not the delayed and coldish food. I’ve walked by them many times on my way to CVS and Whole Foods since the incident and haven’t gone back to eat there...not had my partner ; not that my patronage was missed; I just remember the delayed cold meal and lack of service recovery that most (restaurants, hotels, airlines etc) make a gesture to do and it doesn’t look inciting.

The Rubios on Villa La Jolla has plentiful parking (though the lot is packed at lunchtime due to CVS, Whole Foods, and more).

Service here is always quick and kind.

Be sure to get extra garlic sauce on the side - I could drink that stuff it is that good.  I also ordered a ""side"" of tabouli salad.  I say ""side"" because that side is enough for a separate meal itself.  Very fresh couscous, cucumber, parsley, mint, green onion and olive oil.  It said it came with tomato, but I didn't have any in my serving.  Very good though.  I suggest getting a side of the spicy cilantro sauce to add for some added flavor.  Try this restaurant - you can't go wrong.More",February 2018,Kebab Shop Little Italy

Mom and I share the chicken rotisserie plate with a hot side of falafels (10 pieces) and cold side of green lentil and walnut salad. This was so so good- definitely plenty for two , the chicken wasn't spicy but juicy and well marinated. The lentil salad was cool and tangy.

My toddler's kids meal of chicken rotisserie, side of fries and drink was free ( Kids eat free on weekends- in store!)

The service was excellent. It was our first time visiting their restaurant and we were offered samples of any of the salads to help decide. Their garlic yogurt dip is by far my favorite - just the right hint of garlic without leaving you warding off vampires. Personally, though I love most hot sauces n spicy food, I'm not a huge fan of their spicy sauce coz I felt it tastes a little too similar to Sriracha.

Kathy W,50.0,"I've eaten at 3 different Five Guys.  All were extremely good.  I love how I can get my burgers just the way I like them.  My fav toppings are mayo, a little ketchup & pickle relish.  I can't get mayo or relish at most fast...food places. So when faced with having to eat at those, I usually get them plain to go, take them home & add my own toppings.  Yeah, I can eat burgers with the usual tomato, pickle & lettuce, but just not as enjoyable.  Add to that the Five Guys burgers are big, juicy & flavorful, & the bread is fresh & yummy.  Their fries are also good & the portions are huge. Their small size can feed 2 people.

2beans2000,50.0,"A friend asked if I wanted to stop by Five Guys... I had never been before.

My burger was soooooo delicious!

I had a “small burger” (I thought it would be sliders sized-I was wrong!)

They have all kind of add-ons: pickles (so crunchy and...delicious!), mushrooms, grilled onions, and all the other basics of mayo, mustard, ketchup, tomato, and lettuce.  The sauteed mushrooms and pickles were perfect, the crunch of the pickles were unlike any other burger place.

Ok, enough about the pickles!

Don’t forget to add bacon and cheese... great!! (Just this once, have a treat)

So, the “small” burger means one patty.  A large burger means two patties.

The fries were very good also... skin-on, crispy and salty, just the way I like them!!

I don’t go to burger places often.... but whenever I decide to go again, it will be Five Guys!!

Parking is available in the Costa Verde lots where Five Guys is located.

Seating is available inside or outside.More",October 2019,Five Guys
simo11simo,50.0,I was at 10pm at the time of closing and kindly we welcomed us if they were cleaning the room for closing. Price a little higher than the average but my Bacon Cheese Burger was delicious. I will be back safe,July 2019,Five Guys

suzanne4health,30.0,"Okay, Five Guys is respected from DC to La Jolla, for sure!
Five Guys uses fresh ingredients to make their dishes which are made and constructed onsite before your eyes. Hungry while you are waiting? No worries as plenty of roasted peanuts are available to...shell and eat, adding to the fun. Each burger is a personal creation made to the individual's liking. Fries and more fries!! Always more than anyone expects and made from potatoes which have been carefully sourced. Bags of potatoes line the store. The main disappointment for me is the bread which becomes too mushy and soggy for my preference. I'm sure this won't slow me down the next time my boys are interested in getting a good burger and some fries :-))More",November 2017,Five Guys
Cheri W,40.0,"We always enjoy a quick burger at Five Guys in the evening when I don't want to cook. We call in our order and by the time we walk there (6 -10 minutes), our order is ready. I like the veggie sandwich, because I watch...my calorie intake:(green peppers, lettuce,tomatoes grilled onions and mushrooms, $3.69)). My husband always orders the cheeseburger all the way with everything on it. ($7.99). Two types of fresh-cut potatoes fries are offered: Five Guys style (regular fries with salt), and Cajun style (spicy, hot). They're great, but too much for me to eat. My husband gobbles down the Cajun fries in a flash.
We love their milkshakes. I always order the cherry shake with whipped cream and my husband  orders the coffee shake...but there are 11 to choose from.
Hotdogs Kosher style, with cheese, and bacon are also there. So you can pretty much have your pick of any burger...build as you go with bar-b-que, hot or A-1 sauce if you don't want ketchup.
The atmosphere is very noisy all the time because the place is small and orders are always shouted out. But if you don't mind the noise, there are a few tall tables to sit at near the grill and register. There are outside tables as well, for a more relaxed setting.We just get our meals to go and eat at home.
The service is very quick and sure to please.More",May 2017,Five Guys

Have as much on it as you want or as little...they even offer mushrooms.  Yummy!  Fries are perfect.  Service is okay, but I...guess expected in a place like this one (considering how you order).  These burgers are more ""wet"" than most, so be prepared with a bunch of napkins - required!!!  I ended up in there after the lunch hour rush, so many of the tables had not been ""serviced/cleaned.""  Floors/bathrooms also needed a quick cleaning.

flashncrash,50.0,"So I'm down in SD multiple times a year, at least 5x each year and I would say that probably each visit, save one or two times in the past 5 years, I've gone to Tommy's for my fix.  And if I'm driving I get...another dose in Valencia on my way down and on my up.  I pretty much am set in getting their double cheeseburger with everything.  The chili is perfect for a burger, a bit of meat without being chunky which wouldn't work in a burger.  The hamburger patties is the right size for everything you're getting in the double cheeseburger without needing to stretch your mouth wide open.  Sure I love more meat but the regular patties are just right so I don't bother with the upset of the quarter-pound patties.  The pickles and mustard give a tang while the tomato gives some additional moisture.  The cheese?  Well I honestly have to say it gets lost in the whole shebang other than when you first open up the wrapper and snarf up some of the melted cheese on the inside of the wrapper.  When I grab food for the rest of the family there's usually a chili cheese dog for my grandson and and extra container of chili.  I like the fries because they are not salted and though they are not crispy overall I appreciate the substantial size and well cooked insides.  A number of years back Tommy's switched allegiance to Pepsi products but that worked for me as I prefer the flavor of Pepsi.  With Covid you can ask them to mix the soda for you.  Original Tommy's is my favorite burger and since eating my first one in 1978 at their original location at Beverly & Rampart in LA I don't think my opinion will ever change.More",October 2020,Tommy's Original World Famous  Hamburgers

The sandwich was good. They...put a lot of chilis on top of lettuce and tomatos though. I feel that you can buy your own chili beans and throw it in to get your fix. The lady was nice enough to give us peppers. It is definitely greasy, but I do not think it is that bad as people make out to be. Of course it is not outstanding, but I like the option of eating here.
I think the place is average, but being the only Tommy's in San Diego, I like the option of eating here. We are fortunate to have one too. My friends liked the place. And I can certainly come back once in a while if I feel the urge to eat here. I do like the unique chili sandwich that they have here.

After some more chat, cementing the directions in my head, I set off on this spot to provide nutrition, while enjoying the beauty of the greater San Diego area.

Turns out it is an 8 minute walk if going directly between the beach and Which Wich...I digress...once I found the location, in a trendy little area of Orange Avenue, I entered to be greeted by an employee. First question ~ ""Have you been here before?"" I hadn't so she showed me the menu on the wall, immediately to my right.  She then went on to explain how to order, how to pick up a sub bag (that would be the holder of this glorious sub), what comes on the subs, what I can take off, how to indicate any special orders.

fluffnfold,30.0,"My spouse and I enjoyed drinks at the Fantail Café on a Wednesday afternoon in early July 2018. (“Fantail” describes a stern [back end/aft] that starts at the water and widens as it goes upwards. On the USS Midway, it refers to the overhanging rear...deck.) The outdoor café is open during museum hours (approximately 10:00 am until 4:00 pm), and you must purchase admission to reach it.

The Fantail Café is located aboard the USS Midway Museum, a decommissioned aircraft carrier anchored aside Navy Pier in the San Diego Bay. Positioned on the stern of the ship, you reach the café by walking through the museum store on the hangar deck. Seating is available at round high-top metal tables with barstools, or at regular-height square metal tables and chairs either on the fantail or on an adjacent side deck area (on the ship’s elevator platform that was used to transport aircraft from the hangar deck to the flight deck). The fantail offers views of Tuna Park (with the Bob Hope and V-J Day statues and Fish Market/Top of the Market restaurant), the city, and the Embarcadero/Seaport Village. An additional counter-service option on the fantail serves Starbucks products, and another smaller seasonal café is positioned on the flight deck.

The café offers burgers, sandwiches, pizzas, soups, salads, snacks, and drinks (including beer), which you stand in line to order and receive. We only enjoyed some drinks, but many people were eating full fast-casual meals when we visited. Past reviews complain about the prices, but we did not find them expensive when you consider that you have no other options during your tour. 

The Fantail Café provides a cool (literally and figuratively) place to take a break!More",July 2018,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60750-d1112948-Reviews-Fantail_Cafe-San_Diego_California.html

Pradeep M,40.0,"Taco Bell used to be our backup kitchen during school days. We used to affectionately call it as taco hell.

Today we ordered, my favourite chalupa, Doritos taco and bowl. Chalupa and taco were as usual good. But we were impressed by bowl. Very close...and better than Chipotle.

Price-wise, Taco Bell is clearly cheaper at $5.50, compared to Chipotle's $7.50, A $2 difference is lot. For sure Chipotle had more total weight

Their ingredients had obvious differences. Lettuce in our Cantina bowl threw us off. They fail to even mention the greens on their website. Was this a salad, minus the crispy, 500+ calorie tostada shell? It had a creamy cilantro dressing, so that would be a ""Yes"". Guacamole would've cost us extra at Chipotle.

When we break it down between individual components, we were going head-to-head with a few shared ingredients: chicken, black beans, corn salsa and rice. The quality of these would matter the most.

Chipotle's burrito bowl is for hungry and taco cantina bowl is for healthy version.

If you're seeking a salad bar of flavors, we say step right up and grab a Cantina bowl. However a bowl is a bowl, and should not be mistaken for a salad. Our version of a Hungry Man dinner is Chipotle, without a doubt.More",January 2017,Taco Bell

The_Old_Bill,50.0,"When you wander down 5th Ave in the Gaslamp District, there are many great restaurants, pubs, food joints and stores. But the Doner Grill is almost a hole in the wall along the street. A long, narrow store, with the cooking at the front and...some tables inside. No fancy decoration, but clean and tidy.

Much of the business is take-out, but if you choose to stay and eat in, it's just as good. We had found this place some time before on a visit to San Diego and brought the family this time. Gyro meat forms the basis of the meals, which include salad, and possibly souvlaki bread is appropriate. Sometimes a souvlaki is all you need, but a full meal is also worth having.

For a little place like this you tend to think lower quality. But you'd be wrong. The food is fresh and delicious. Forget the extras you don't eat, come for the food, because that's where the Donar Gill excels. There is no fancy style: a meal is in a plastic container and paper napkins and plastic knives and forks. Souvlakis rolled in the traditional paper, or paper-lined foil. Forget the fancy stuff, come for the food. The service is only really at the counter, but if you eat in, they'll bring it to your table. The people are busy but friendly. Things move quickly, but you want the food; and that's the best part.

Definitely going to get another a repeat visit. This isn't the place for a fancy night out, and perhaps not even for a first date. But if you want a quick meal that is of high quality, this should definitely be on your list.More",February 2018,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60750-d6833250-Reviews-Doner_Mediterranean_Grill-San_Diego_California.html

zanevorhis,40.0,"Went here for the first time today. I ordered ""the grinder"" with double meat, 14 inch, no drink or sides. Order came out to $15, which would have been $11 had I not got double meat.

Comparing it to Subway, Quiznos and Panera I would...prefer this above the 3. First off, you don't order at a register. You fill out a card at the entrance that tells you the sandwiches and you pick your veggies, bread etc all on the card. You then go to the register, pay and they start working on your order. 

I came in Friday at 12:30, right at the lunch rush and was out at 12:37. Took my food back to work and decided to finish my lunch at my desk. I managed to get crumbs everywhere, but that is my fault because I am inherently messy. 

The bread was not stale, but it did not feel entirely fresh. It was semi hard, for a nontoasted sandwich. But 14 inches managed to be digested just fine. So what sets this place from the other places? Probably the quality of meat tasted fresher than other places and it was all priced the same for every sandwich. No matter what you got the price was the same.

I had extremely negative experience today! I was checking at the register if they had smoothy, the said no, then I asked if they have kombucha and the girl behind the counter said yes without mentioning that the kombucha contains the alcohol...with 5% which is a lot like a beer. She didn't even asked my ID. After taking a sip I have realized that it has alcohol. I know the mistakes happen all the time so I asked the manager or whoever was talking to me (tall guy with long hair) to get my money back as the 2 kombuchas are $14 total. He angrily replied to me that he won't return my money and not even the orange juice because it's a money waste for the restaurant. That was so disrespectful and unprofessional as I'm a driver and he was actually forcing my to get that kombucha or GTFOut from there!

  A HUMONGOUS menu board on the wall. A zillion kinds of tacos, burgers, plates. All sounded delicious. The food is cheap.  Lots of outdoor tables.  I gobbled down my taco outdoors before we hit the boat!

It was late, so my two boys and I decided to go...to Wendy's for a burger. They have the serving all night sign. Well, we walk there taking about 5-minutes. The place is locked-up accept the drive-thru. There were no cars and there were a few people working behind the counter. I tried to place an order by walking up to the window. We were denied. I asked should I go get my car and come back to order? It didn't make sense to me if I ordered with or without my car. Again, no cars in line late at night and the folks weren't doing anything. Instead, we left and ordered out at Denny's, which was very good by the way. I understand rules, but I also believe business is business.

So thought I would check it out.  So an amazing list of burritos and...tacos.  And not just everyday stuff.  It was the stuff that legends are made of.  My friend had the surf and turf burritos (shrimp and steak and other tasty things) and I had the Birra Burrito (which was beef and beans).  The premise is “self serve”. You order at the cash register, pick your drinks and then saunter over to the salsa bar to pick out the type of salsa that floats your boat.  When your food is ready, they call your name and you pick it up.

So the food was excellent - messy but excellent none the less.  If you are looking of Mexican with a twist, this is the ticket.  There are three locations in San Diego.  Gotta try it.More",September 2019,Lucha Libre Taco Shop

I always have issues here, and today we went in mid-afternoon before dinner time, and they were out of half of the types of bread. No wheat,...no white, no flatbread, etc. How do you run out of the most wanted types of bread, in the middle of the afternoon! Terrible management. Oh, and to top it off, out of chocolate chip cookies. Didn't even bother buying something we didn't want...went somewhere else to eat.

Lynne0725,30.0,"We were told that this was the place to go for Carne Asada fries. Not being terribly hungry but always into trying something new, we decided to share a large order. Carne Asada fries are a combination of angus beef, guacamole, sour cream, cheddar cheese,...and cotija cheese. They were just OK mainly because we felt the beef desperately needed to be marinated as it had very little flavor. Must say the condiment bar had fresh vegetables and salsas, and the place was very clean. In their apparent attempt to keep noncustomers from using their restroom, there was a combination lock on the door; they did graciously give out the combination. We will definitely try something different next time.More",November 2019,Lolita's

Jayfromcali,30.0,"The only reason this isn’t a 1 is because the food is very good. There is a reason the to go wait line is long. The reason being the staff would have a tough time p’n you off when you are out of the building....11 AM the place is filling fast and the employees behind the counter have decided the the only one taking orders should take the phone orders too. So 20 people wait in line in front of the only open register while she talks on the phone.   Really?  There are two or three others getting food from the kitchen as it comes up and they are mostly standing as they wait for orders. 
I finally get my order in and take my number sign and go look for a table. 
All the tables are full. Two of them have employees at them, both with a fountain drink one texting with great furry on her oversized phone. I waited about two minutes next to text girl and the other employee said here sir take this table. Text girl looks up to give him the “look” and right back to texting for the next 15 minutes. 
So, bus your own table, never saw an employee with a towel. Nothing about this place can make me come back to eat in. Get your food to go. Many people know this.

12:45 pm aug 31 2019

After sitting freezing in Scripps Mercy Hospital, i was finally released hours later  just like any other normal hospital visit. I decided to take my own blanket because everyone knows hospitals are super cold to keep...down germs, so i figured I'd be 2 steps ahead, i grabbed my Arizona Cardinals blanket a very nice thick not Soo big fan based cover. Upon discharge i drove over to CVS which is litterly almost across the street, turned in my prescription and was told i ha to make sure i had food to take the medicine as well so i walked on over to La posta a 24hr walk up order resturant , still wrapped in my blanket over my body only as I'm looking at the menu i see my wife walking up to give me my wallet, so I meet her at the corner 10ft away i come back and continue to look at the menu unable to decide what i wanted to order since i had never been here and am on vacation from Texas. I decided to sit and see if i had enough cash or the right debit card i use at restaurants or had it been left in the console  from prior use ... Within literaly 2 mins a Hispanic lady approached me after coming out the building and said excuse me sir you can't sit here so i figured something must be wrong with the bench although it was concrete so maybe it was just wet so i moved over to the next seat and the lady then says no no no you need to leave 🤔 completely confused i asked what do you mean i need to leave? She then stated you can't order from here just leave....i had no clue period to what was going on as 3 Hispanic guys ordered perfectly fine ahead of me and me reading the sign that says open 24 hours🤨 so i asked again what was the reason i couldn't order was it because i was wearing a blanket? And explained that i was just leaving the hospital and getting my prescription filled She said no you just need to leave I saw you walk by 2 times already...😲 ...yet I only walked to meet my wife for the wallet.what is really going on here is the only thought in my head, am I not allowed to order being a black man? Was she convinced that i was homeless because I had my blanket? Why were the Hispanic guys able to order?without a doubt  I knew I had completely been racial profiled and asked to leave for no logical reason at all. I walked to get my car from next door at CVS came back and asked again after showing money my state identification card and my car a 2017 Dodge Challenger hellcat pointing at texas license plate as well, stating I'm not even from here this time the lady said now i can't order because i have a attitude now  and it wasn't about me having my blanket which i know was her cover-up after making a mistake and racial profiling me. How could I had an attitude if I only looked at the menu like a normal ordering customer and never spoke a word? 3 witnesses were present. All is filmed on camera,... I definitely want a manager or owner of the company to reach out to me and explain because I too am a business owner myself.More",August 2019,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60750-d1015591-Reviews-La_Posta_de_Acapulco-San_Diego_California.html
George A,50.0,"As much as I travel there is a tendancy to take home gound for granted. I have travelled all over the world in my business and for pleasure. I've eaten in some of the finest 5 star restaurant around the globe. But eventually you return...home to what you might call ""The Real World"". 

My routine upon returning home from a long international trip is to hit one of my favorite local restaurants (Really a Taco Stand). I've litterally stopped by La Posta de Acapulco on the way home from a 12 hour international flight. Whatever the length of my vacation I seem to always go into a kind of withdrawal after the first week or so craving only one meal, two chicken tacos & three rolled tacos with just cheese. Honestly, in 20+ years being a loyal customer I order the same exact meal every time. 

Oh, there's lots of choices on their menu, and I'm more than positive they are all equally wonderful, but my routine stays the same. I'm am truly a Creature Of Habit when it comes to eating at La Posta.

I've eaten Mexican cuisine all over the world and in some strange places that you would not expect it, like Copenhagen or Nigeria (actually prepared by a Chinese gentleman), and even with the 1000+ Mexican restaurants in San Diego, no other restaurant comes even close to the taste & quality of food served at La Posta, especially the Chicken & Rolled Tacos...The Best!

La Posta is about the size of a one-car garage and there are usually no more than three people preparing the food inside. The food is always fresh tasting & prepared quickly. This is kind of the epitome of fast food dining. Bascically order and take away. There are only four little concrete & tiled top tables out front. 99% of the time it's grab & go for me. Nothing like eating at home in front of the Big Screen with a cold beer.

So, if you're visiting San Diego for a period of time or just a happy local like me, make the trip up to 3rd & Washington in the Hillcrest area so you can say ""I had the Best Chicken Tacos I've ever eaten"".....I hear the Carne Asada Burritto is tops too!

I'll never take my home town of San Diego or my weekly visits to La Posta for granted.More",April 2019,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60750-d1015591-Reviews-La_Posta_de_Acapulco-San_Diego_California.html

Yummy rolled tacos with guacamole, and 19 wonderful burritos combinations  filled with carne asada, carnitas, or their special California burrito. We love their crispy chips...so light and fresh!

I suggested we had half meatball (less one ball) and half another choice the same price just different ingredients each end! We agreed as it wasn't really my first choice but made no difference and I didn't want to wait!

Proper planning would have had all menu options available! 

At checkout the same and only staff member tried to charge me for two 6 inch subs! I was willing to sacrifice my original choice for something else but despite my questioning of the cost she still tried to charge me for the two! 

This was Subways fault for not having their menu available! Good customer service would have just given me what I had asked for or equivalent for the same price even thought it was not my 1st choice!

Eventually it was going to cost me 30% for what I originally wanted!

bazi43,50.0,"My friends are puzzled by the fact that on every driving trip to Tijuana, I stop for a taco or two at Armando's (either on the way into Mexico or on the way out.

""You're going to the land of tacos - so why stop...at this strip-mall joint in San Diego???""

All I can say is that when I was a kid growing up in the San Fernando Vally, there was a joint with outdoor seating by a little pond and in the pond were ducks.  This place was called 'Taco Tia' and that was my very first experience of tacos.  We'd feed the ducks and eat this messy exotic food.

Since then, I've had tacos in dozens of cities in several countries, and learned all about the many many many varieties of tacos...  my friends call me 'Taco Jones.'

And Armando's serves up a pretty big chicken taco that is amazingly like that taco of my childhood.  Their green salsa is wonderful.  They serve up other foods too, and I've eaten some of them... but then when i get to the counter, I think, ""Why order anything else when the taco is my favorite in the world?""  (Full disclosure:  almost *every* taco that I eat is my favorite in the world... in that moment - that's why I'm there then eating them.)

So mama didn't make tacos - but they are my comfort food & I love them & i will keep hitting Armando's trip after trip after trip... just writing this makes me hungry for an Armando's taco!More",July 2015,Armando's Mexican Food

I mediately call Carl's Jr because we had paid $15 and was not happy that Carl's Jr Drive Thru felt it was okay to handle burgers and buns in this condition. Hey young lady answered the telephone and heard my concern she stated that Carl's Jr would take care of it since she agreed that it was expensive to have received such a product in that condition. She put us on hold while she spoke with a manager to see what could be done, upon her return she stated that we could come in for 2 free meals I thanked her for the offer however explain that we resided 3 hours away at which time she stated that her manager stated that they could molest coupons in the mail. I appreciated the offer and provided information. I had to call a week later to inform him that I have not received any coupons or refund on my meal and they still stated that a manager would contact me. I will be contacting Carl's Jr Corp in emailing any pertinent staff to show them the food quality that is going out of their restaurant. We will not be stopping here its a regular the regular stop on our way to Rosarito but no longer.More",July 2014,Carl's Jr.

GreenUnicorn,30.0,"We needed to have breakfast and then buy lunch to take on the plane.  Unfortunately, Terminal 2 has very few options.  We wound up at CPK after looking at the other choices, such as they were.

For breakfast, we both had the ham/cheese/egg sandwich. It...is made by adding ham to the cheese and bread, then putting the sandwich in the microwave.   It was ok, and although expensive, not outrageously priced, unlike the $3.29 bottle of Diet Coke.

For lunch my husband got the turkey sandwich but forgot to ask for mustard.  It was pretty dry and did not have that generous a portion of turkey.  I got the chicken Cobb salad, which was ok, but for $11.49, it could have used some more ingredients.  I did not overeat!  The $5.59 fruit cup had very nice fruit in it.

DaRocha1104,10.0,"A terribly-run operation in a bad location, especially regarding traffic safety.  My three experiences here (since the place reopened after being remodeled) have been negative.  Just getting into the drive-up queue is a nightmare in terms of spacing behind vehicles wrapped around the building in...a u-shape.  The  drive-through service is slow, which adds to the congestion in the parking lot--whilst several vehicles wanting to leave the lot cannot get out because of the back-log of cars in the order line.

Service inside the store is not much better.  Wait-time is slow; I've waited over half-an-hour at 11:15 in the morning.  Workers try, but the congestion of this place (caused in part because so many other Arby's have closed) makes my blood pressure explode; therefore, I can't risk coming here again.

As her team scrambles to get my what I ordered, all I get from her, while her back is to me is ""im sorry....we're training."" Disappointed in this answer, I tell her training is good, but it shouldn't be at my expense, to which all I get is another ""im sorry.""

That felt like a true lack of leadership and poor customer resolution in my opinion.  No efforts on her part what so ever.  No attempts to recover my satisfaction or make amends, just a lazy ""im sorry.""  I truly don't blame Connies team, they were moving fast and trying to make it right, but was very sad to see the lack of effort from the Manager.

If you are used to having very good Mexican food, this place won’t redefine Mexican food for you, but they make very good tacos and burritos. I ordered surf and turf tacos...which came in a homemade tortilla filled with fillings including the shrimp and steak, lettuce and onions with a colorful covering of queso and chipotle sauces. The steak was tender and shrimp was perfectly cooked. They make a very good taco and one that is larger than some other restaurants. 

I also ordered a Surfin’ Cali burrito. Like the taco, the fillings were very good. Steak was tender and shrimp was perfectly cooked. The fries were a little bland and could have been crispier. The cheese, tomatoes and onions balanced out the ingredients with the same very tasty sauces. Again a very good burrito. Service was very quick and polite.

vasileiosb373,50.0,"The best ""kitsch"" restaurant we ever visited. The whole decoration is very inspired with a solid theme which is applied to every corner.
Food was perfect and the portions were very rich.
We booked the ""Champ's Booth"" which was a very unique experience to dine...in a very different way.
Also the Staff was very polite, caring and fun. Don't forget to try local beers and all the starter sauces.

RooseE_12,30.0,"In a city that is known for some of the leading burger shops in the nation, Stack Shack frankly embarrasses the city of San Diego.  I just ate a burger at their airport location while awaiting a flight.  The bun and Lettuce was fine but...the heart of the burger was disappointing -- the Patty was over cooked dry and lacked any flavor.  I guess the best you can say for this place is it's par for the course for the usual low quality food served at our nation's airports.

VSSUBR,20.0,"This was a quick place for my wife and kids to have dinner at San Diego airport (I sampled theirs). The kids ordered burgers, while my wife had the chicken sandwich. First, we didn't find the chicken tasty at all - it was flavorless and...dry. The kids' burgers were barely ok and they only ate about half of their meal (which is unusual for them). On the plus side, the fries were excellent.

Service was surly - maybe the fact that it was around 9pm when we ordered left the woman at the counter tired and grumpy. When my kids asked for ketchup, she gave them one packet - just one. We had to ask again for more which we eventually did get.

We took it with us, got on our flight, and enjoyed one of the best sandwiches we've ever eaten.  I think everyone around us on the flight was a little jealous as we ""oooed"" and ""awed"" over how tasty it was.  I sure wish there was a Stack Shack here in Utah where I live.

The ambience is clean fast food, with outdoor seating and off-street parking.  The food, however, was outstanding....Subtle spice flavors, fresh and well-seasoned foods, quick preparation and friendly service.  My husband had seafood tacos, and I had one of the bowls.  We were both swooning over the flavors, and he even inquired about buying one of the sauces (you can, but only in bowls, which won't travel).

Tom F,40.0,"This is one terrific guilty pleasure. Yes, its fast food and yes the restaurants aren't  known for their  atmosphere.  

But, 

the spicy chicken is the best fried chicken to be found.  The red beans & rice taste as good as what you get on the...Gulf Coast.  The taste is very rich,  not overly spicy,  but lingering.  The biscuits are fresh-baked and buttery.  

There are always special deal ""family meals"" that are huge bargains.  Just ask, ""What's the best deal today?"" Two can go  for lunch,  order a family meal, and take home a couple of days of leftovers.  Left-over Popeyes chicken (reheated in the oven, not the microwave) is better than most others' freshly prepared.        

Tip:   Ask for several packets of ""Cajun Sparkle.""  It looks  like a flat pink packet of salt or pepper,  but its a mixture of all the dry spices that make  cajun and creole taste like cajun and creole.More",May 2013,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60750-d841749-Reviews-Popeyes_Louisiana_Kitchen-San_Diego_California.html

So thank you - bit of an unexpected treat in Blandsville USA.More",March 2017,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60750-d923895-Reviews-Cafe_Socrates-San_Diego_California.html

I added mushrooms to their classic patty melt and it was delish.

They minimize garbage and plastic by serving on a metal tray with a paper liner.  The napkins are compostable.  Nice.

There’s a big parking lot out front, but during lunchtime and around 5pm it’s crazy hard to find a spot because CVS and Whole food are in the same shared area.

You quickly notice the entire place is grimy, the walls, floors and tables all needed a good scrubbing. There was something that looked like a dehumidifier running in the dining area...with the cord stretched as a trip hazard across the order line.

We were hungry and had some time restraints so we decided to stay and approached the menu board. My wife chose the swiss and shroom grilled chicken sandwich with mac n cheese while I ordered the steak and cheese sandwich with fries. They gave us a pager and we had a seat.

When the pager went off, we went to pick up our order. My wife's mac and cheese was on my tray with my sandwich and my fries we're on my wife's tray with her sandwich. Not a problem we just swapped them. Everything look really good however we both thought that our meals were just kind of bland.

Great place for a cheesesteak sandwich.

FOOD
This is what I tried:
 
-Mushroom cheesesteak
-garlic fries
 
Simple and tasty.   This place knows how to make a great cheesesteak.   Plus at the asking price, can’t get a better deal.

PARKING...Yes, in a strip mall.

SERVICE
Order at counter, pick up at counter.
PRICE
$12-ish for a cheesesteak

Zero Quality Control.  Gag-me bros need to remove their name or execute a surprise visit.

john r,50.0,"Been here many times for takeout but never bothered to write a review.  Today we came on a Sunday afternoon after what I thought was lunch rush hour.  I was wrong, the place was packed with only one table left.  Got the usual philly cheese...and it was good as always, never tough like some other well known chains (Jersey Mike's).  Got the cole slaw which was a first for me and it was very fresh and very good.  Wife said this was maybe the best cole slaw she has ever had.  Fries were excellent, not skinny fries, the kind I like, but more normal size, but they were crispy like skinny fries.  The brothers deserve 5 stars.

What motivated me to post a review was a comment on the receipt from the manager.  He said ""Call for help before you Yelp.""  Sorry I didn't call for help, none needed.  Didn't think he would mind me giving 5 stars.

The service was friendly and the place was busy, indicating they served good food.  I got the 9 inch standard, took it home, opened it up and found a...bun that tasted like it had been thawed in a microwave for way too long (chewey and tasteless) and a filling that rememinded me of the descriptions of Taco Bell's filling.  It was mush.  The meat should have been cut in thin slices and grilled to crispy then mixed with veg and cheese.  This was gushy and not very tasty.  I doubt I'll be going back.

3dogmum,30.0,"Mexican Subway . . . the way the food preparer described how to order.  His service was EXCEPTIONAL!  Wish I had taken note of his name because the company deserves to know how great he is (we were there on May 10 around 4 pm)....I really liked being able to have the burritos custom made (I'm a Subway fan).  They were very tasty but stone cold when we ate them (we live 5 mins. away so did take-away).  Burritos from other take-aways have always arrived home still hot.  We thought $1.95 for guacamole was a tad steep and adding it would make the price nearly $10.  I guess we were spoiled by La Salsa (now closed).  If the price of the burrito included guacamole and it didn't get so cold so quickly, I would give this place a much higher rating.  Can't fault the staff because they both were great.  If I intended to eat on site so my food was still hot, my rating definitely would be a 4 (a 5 if guacamole was included).More",May 2016,Chipotle Mexican Grill
Natalie A,10.0,"Here on a brief stay in San Diego, my partner and I were caught in a rainstorm while out looking for a decent place to eat in Mission Valley when she said 'let's eat there'. What a freakin' mistake. I've often heard the hype about...this place and have mostly ignored it though I knew it could not be accurate. Here's what is accurate: The 'burrito' such as it is is assembled by serfs dressed in black t-shirts (very cool...NOT!!!) who look like the morons I used to see serving food at institutional cafeterias but these princes and princesses are in their 20s and 30s and I'm sure think they're hot. They're not and neither was the food. The burritos are overstuffed with cheap rice, some bits of meat are thrown in, and covered in a drape-like tasteless tortilla. The tables were uniformly dirty, the floor was wet from the rain - seems no one was capable of using an opposing thumb on a mop - and the service, if one could call it that, almost alienating. I will NEVER eat at this chain again and am now kicking myself for agreeing to this most unfortunate decision.

bee343,40.0,"Honestly, the food is served hot and fresh. You can take from the menu or they will do special requests then and there. I wanted a fish taco, but I wanted it with flour tortillas instead of corn. The staff told the cooks and they...created it there on the spot. I got two fish tacos using their method out of it. No one in my humble opinion can make a fish burrito like them. The fish is warm inside and plentiful portions. I eat their regular beef tacos, and have ordered the flautas with beef, and its enormous portion size made with your choice of toppings. I eat here around three to four days. Most of the time the line is out the door and the place is packed inside and out with people staying to eat. Don't go at noon. I see the military and local boat personnel in there as often as I can go. Be aware that the cooks are cooking call-in orders too, so the wait can be longer then you anticipated. Keep your cool also if you see others getting their orders quicker, as they are shorter orders like a burrito and they need to clear the place out sometimes for that reason too I think. Mostly though they do go in the order customers place them. I order for lunch then for my dinner at home that night. I really think the staff is terrific and friendly and very polite. The place is clean, and improvements have been made to the inside with new furniture and more choices on the menu with fresh fruit and modern drinks. I like the what they offer, too many choices before but now. It's crowded a lot but worth the wait I think. The owner is one of the cooks so know all is working well, and does even when I go in and he is not there on the line. He is the one who created my flour fish tacos.

SouthWestBound,50.0,"I usually write 1K words to describe how good a place is. This one shouldn’t need that. Just go. But for those sceptical among you...

Middle-Eastern restaurants seem to abound in San Diego, particularly in the Hillcrest/Mission Hills district.  While we’ve only tried this one...and even though it’s a chain, I’m pretty sure it’s the best most optimal quality/price ratio you will find. First, we got the Original Hummus with sliced veggies as a starter.  Then, I had the Bistro Filet Beef Kabob plate while my lovely wife opted for the Chicken Kabob Plate.  The hummus was obviously made either to order or for sure on the same day. Creamy with just the right balance of tahini, lemon and garlic. A total bliss.  And each morsel of beef adorning my plate was cooked to perfection, tender, juicy, pink in the middle.  My wife’s chicken was equally perfect, not overcooked and masterfully seasoned. In both cases, a delicately fluffy rice (iranian style) and a nice salad with just enough dressing completed the offering.  A few wedges of fresh warm pita also accompanied our plates.  They have two beers on tap, one of which is among my faves (Stone IPA) and 3-4 wine choices in each category (red and white).  Oh, and the free wifi, although really not essential, was downright solid!  Although you order at the counter, Talladega style, you are served at your table and the service is not only professional but also friendly and casual.

You also get a small scoop of imitation crab meat, japanese green seaweed, some avocado, cucumbers, green onions. You get a choice of sauces so I chose both the gomae and spicy aioli and both were good. The bowl is a good size and I even had leftovers that I couldn't finish.

My son had he poke burrito and he enjoyed it because it had less rice. It was the same price as the bowl but I felt the bowl had a larger portion for sure.

 The tacos were so flavorful and I had never had a Mulita before. I tried the carnitas and pollo tacos and a pescado Mulita and they were all amazing! I would get the roasted corn again, however minus the mayonessa which just isn't for me.

And made no attempt to fix the problem. We'd ordered a bowl of beans... She brought no utensils. When we asked, she told us to go get them inside. We wanted water... It was serve yourself, and there was no ice. Again, I believe they are in transition, but they shouldn't even be open yet if they can't do better than this.

The soup that comes in a bread bowl looks interesting, but it's hard for me...to believe it's not more of a gimmick than a real attempt to make eating any easier or more convenient.
The location is good, as it is fairly central to northern San Diego City, and is not far from the 805.  The toilets are clean, ans it's kept pretty clean throughout.  The only common complaint is the volume of the music, which they seem to keep turned way up, as if to discourage conversation, get people to eat, and then leave immediately, so it's not the best setting for group meetings, though our group has been meeting there for several years now.More",December 2019,Panera Bread

The cashier was less than friendly and you could tell she didnt want to be there. She also didnt ask me what sides I...wanted with my order and just decided them for me.. I guess that doesnt matter because I never received them anyway. What I ordered:

You Pick Two: French Onion Soup and Chicken Caesar (side baguette)
Chipotle Panini (side of chips)
Large Chicken Caesar Salad (side baguette)
Mac and Cheese (side of yogurt)

I received about 1/2 of the above order, but unfortunately didnt realize this until I was already home... There was no chicken on the chicken caesar salads, and no sides for any of the meals. The panini was so sloppy almost all of the ingredients fell out of the sandwich before eating it. Waste of $30.00 to still be hungry.

Satori_Is,50.0,"I've known this place since they opened in 1984. I was a student at UCSD, living in an apartment just a few yards away. One day, I saw a pleasant couple of mom and pop opening a small taco shop. I went in, got a...carne asada burrito, and fell in love with it. Big tasty grilled steak, with the right amount of guacamole, onion, and cilantro, NO rice or beans. I don't know how many burritos I ate there over the years, but to this day, I make sure to visit this shop every time I visit San Diego. Now I live in Silicon Valley, I miss it. The only place that comes close to Los Dos Pedros is one in Merced, which is too far away.

Just recently (July 2018), I visited San Diego with my family and had my favorite carne asada burrito there. The guys told me that the old mom and pop are still living nearby, doing well. I was happy to hear that.

I settled for a combo dinner.  The cheese enchilada was a bit solid ( I would prefer melty cheese), but the shredded beef taco was great.  I asked for all beans and no rice, but got both and didn't send it back.  

I would go back to this place just for the margarita.  I liked that they specifically offered blended or on the rocks and asked if you wanted salt on the rim or not.  I hate it when they assume you want salt.

Mytravelbucket,30.0,San Diego Burger Company located in the food court of SeaPort Village offers very tasty burgers and crispy fries or onion rings.  The prices are a bit high but considering it is located in a tourist area its to be expected. The place has a...very nice tiled patio with tables for patrons to enjoy their food. The problem is that pigeons hang around to see what they might steal from your plate. I had never experienced such aggressive pigeons. You can shoo them away and they come right back and land on your table. At our visit one table was not occupied but it needed wiping up. We asked for the table to be cleaned and were given a wet towel to clean it ourselves! Not the customer service we expected. Overall the hamburgers are good as are the fries and onion rings. If you decide to buy the food here I'd suggest moving to the general outside patio area away from the pigeons.More,September 2018,San Diego Burger Company

blw_at_longwood,30.0,"This little place is right by the waterside at Seaport, and it's even got a little bit of shade of its own, so it can be a nice stop. The burgers are your typical $8 burger these days. The burgers themselves are pretty good and...reasonably priced relative to location. It was fresh. However, a tip is to ask how much the drink/fries package is, which I didn't do - the price isn't listed on the board, or if it is, it's not where it would be noticed. The burger meal is $16, which I found to be rather stiff even considering the location. The fries are of the curly variety, at least by taste and consistency, even though they're not actually curly.

EdibleLife,30.0,"FOOD: ⭐️⭐️
SERVICE: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

After watching a handful of vlogs where folks were raving about the fried chicken, I just had to try it for myself. It’s was 11:30 am-ish on a Saturday, I wasn’t surprised about how busy it was (long drive-thru line and...all tables inside were occupied). 

We were fourth in line to order, so it didn’t seem bad, but it sure did take a long time before it was our turn. Not sure what the hold up was but it did take a while to get to order. I read a bunch of reviews that mentioned awful service, but I experienced great friendly service from the cashier to the lady cleaning the tables, and even the manger who I i asked for some bags for the leftovers. 

Now the food: I wanted to really like the fried chicken, but my drumstick was not even hot (it was crispy though) and I ate it right when we brought it from the counter to the table. It could be that the air conditioner was on full arctic blast and it felt like I was having lunch in an igloo - so uncomfortable! The taste of the fried chicken was decent, not too oily and nice light crispy batter but nothing special.

We also ordered the spaghetti, which was also barely warm. I knew their spaghetti was on the sweet side, but it was a bit overly sweet for my taste. There were also some thick shreds of some kind of cheese, which didn’t enhance the flavor in any way. I also ordered the Palabok, as it is one of my favorite Filipino noodle dishes, but I didn’t like theirs. It looked promising but was just plain ole bland. On to the cheese burger... one of the worst burgers of any fast food watery. It was tiny, over cooked, and cheese wasn’t even melted. The fries were decent. 

What was really good and memorable was their pineapple juice. This was my first time trying Jollibee’s and I don’t think I’ll be craving to go back anytime soon. I really wanted to like this place too!More",January 2020,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g32767-d830553-Reviews-Jollibee-National_City_California.html

Place: 
There were not many people when we ordered but soon reputation kicks in and whole place is busy ,...mostly families , couples . 

Food: Quality is very good . Honestly above expectations , at the price at which it is offered. Generally we missed actual taste of Indian food whenever we had Indian food in San Diego but this place is different. We had masala dosa ,dahi poori etc and my family members loved everything. 

Service and Staff: Friendly , helping staff for sure. No negatives here as well. Service could be little better but no complaints for that since many guests arrived after our first order . We had relaxed time so some wait time was not a problem for us .

Budget:  Five stars . I don't think I can get the same food quality , service and taste anywhere else in California . Just one complaint here, they accept only CASH.

Overall we are very much satisfied and definitely visit again and yes will bring my guests/friends too .More",July 2017,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60750-d945666-Reviews-Surati_Farsan_Mart-San_Diego_California.html

We spoke to some guys who said they travelled across the border just to come and have these tacos. The they told me that now they have locations in Las Vegas on the strip as well as in Henderson. I told them years ago I went to one in San Diego area. So the other day when I was in San Diego I googled and found a few locations and decided that the one in National City was the closest. When I drove up it said tacos El G. Yes the tacos were good and the same cheese for the quesadillas and they make the corn tortillas right there. But the price was quite a bit more but not having to cross the border it was close enough. You did order at the counter but turned and paid right away then ate.

I ordered a bean and cheese burrito with extra cheese. I also asked for salsa on the side.  Bean and cheese was so so….it barely had any cheese and the texture of the food was not the best.  Anyhow, the worst part was the salsa.  As a Latina I am very well aware of good tasting salsas. The red salsa (given in small plastic containers) was very salty.  I love salty food…but boy I had 2 and that was enough for me. Salsa was bland (not spicy at all) and lack seasonings.  Not returning to this restaurant.

The place was spacious compared to the other Mexican Restaurants here, but the ordering method was the same. You prepay, and then get a table. You pick up your food when they call out your number after the order is ready.

Between us we got the California Burrito, the Fried Tilapia Platter and the Chicken Tacos. Everything was fresh and the portions were large with generous sides of Rice and Beans. We had enough for lunch the following day. The Starter Chips were hot and crunchy, and the Salsa Bar was amazing with a huge variety of Sauces.

It remains one of his favorites too.  The location is nice with outside seating but nothing to let you know how good it is, other than all the people ordering.  So, why is it so good?  I tell you:  “I don’t know.” There is not one thing you can point to and say “that is the reason.”  It is just everything is high quality and tasty.  I’ve tried many different options but always come back to the Shrimp Diablo burrito.  I’ve had it both wet (with sauce) and dry but think I lean, just a little, to the dry.  Not a firm rule as I had it wet today.  We also split an order of nachos supreme with asada.  Bad idea from the perspective of the amount of food.  Great idea from a taste perspective.

Or the time in July we ate shrimp tacos in La Jolla, then drove all the way back to La Mesa to...eat again at Tako Factory? 
Is it that the owners who bring our food out at least pretend to remember us, and we don't even live in San Diego? 
Is it your carne asada burrito, that puts Roberto's/Alberto's/Los Panchos to shame? 
No, I think it's your rolled-tacos that are handmade and NOT from Costco. 
I just wish your music wasn't quite so loud.

HurdyGurdyMan,50.0,I was staying at a hotel nearby and kept passing this place.  I read they had great burritos and I went for breakfast. Wow. California style burritos are the bomb. They put crispy fries in there and a creamy dressing. I had no idea how...good a burrito could be.  Forget chipotle and all those other burrito shops. Tako Factory has them beat hands down. I think they're even making their own tortillas there. Really good. I even got a free Mexican soda for checking in on Yelp.More,February 2015,Tako Factory

But now & then, we get a craving for good Fish & Chips!  So we checked online and found a tasty restaurant - Mr. Fish &...Chips.  Plus, they serve many brands of canned beers. (and an Ol'Irish Pub next door (no pub food)).

It looks cute outside - w a small exterior patio.  Not much ambiance inside (but did I mention the cute, old fashion Pub next door).

Reasonably priced  ($11.99 for 2 large pieces of fish & chips).  Skip the fried clams (tasted previously frozen).

On the plus side: fast service, clean dining, nice size filets, plenty of seating, reasonable lunch prices, food is served hot.

Coleslaw was bland, the fries were hot and crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. However, I came here for fish not fries. You are not satisfy your craving for fish here. Chef John's in Lemon Grove can satisfy.

ReviewChimp,30.0,"On my last night in San Diego, I once again made my way to the Westfield shopping complex and decided to have dinner at Noodles & Company.

The menu was fairly large, but I plumped for a large BBQ pork mac and cheese, and disappeared...to get my cutlery. I was fairly dismayed to find the cutlery not particularly clean (some of them still contained dried food clinging on for dear life), and the seating/tables were also similarly unclean.

However, I had already ordered and I was hungry.

Not long after finding a relatively clean table my food came, and it was the single largest portion of pasta I have ever attempted to eat in one sitting. Then again, I did go large...

Although it was a huge portion for the price I paid (pretty sure it was under $9) it wasn't particularly tasty, it was certainly devoid of cheese (bit weird for a mac and cheese but OK), and the pork was quite dry, but the dried jalapeno was nice. I ended up having to get sauces to help me attempt to finish, but failed to do so.

EdibleLife,30.0,"I had a nacho craving for over a week and finally decided to satisfy it when I drove by and saw a small line out the door of Humberto’s. 

The place is small, with about 6-7 crammed tables inside. The lady at the counter was...friendly and I ordered the Carne Assad Chips Supreme (their featured nacho dish on the menu). 

I went to look for a place to sit down, as I was going eat my nachos there, but just about every table was dirty. There were food bits all over the floor throughout, some tables has food bits on them and others had spilled salsa. It was quite gross to be honest. I did find the cleanest table and took a seat. 
When I ordered, there was only 1 person before me, however it took a very long time for my order to be ready. 

I was offered red and green salsa when I picked up my nachos, which I took both to see which was more spicy. As I had been craving nachos for so long, I couldn’t wait to dig in. Unfortunately, their Carne Asada Chips Supreme has nothing supreme about it. The grated cheese was just partially melted, the rest just sat sprinkled on the chips. The carne asada was luke warm at best - considering it took so long for the order, I would have expected hot meat and melted cheese. There was some pico de gallo and guacamole, but very little... and there wasn’t a salsa bar section to get more.

It didn’t taste bad, but I didn’t meet expectation for a featured item on the menu either. Service was good and I would have given 2.5 Stars if half stars were possible.... So 3 it is, based mainly on good service. I will perhaps try the food here again next time, but it won’t be for the Carne Asada Chips Supreme.

The...build-your-pizza option on the website is very useful, considering I am vegetarian. I can make my own personal veggie pizza that I will enjoy. The tracker is also pretty cool.

They make really good pizza. The crust with garlic seasoning is delicious! But I've noticed that these days they have reduced the amount of the tasty garlic seasoning on the pizza.

This Domino's is NOT a sit-down restaurant. They only do deliveries and carryouts. The place is basically a kitchen with a window inside where you can pick up your order. The deliveries for UCSD campus residents are also awesome.

BTW, I love the (temporary?) sweet $7.99 deal on large 3-topping pizzas (carryouts only) on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

araglex,10.0,Visited this place for second time with my wife. First time was good and that's why we decided to revisit them. This second visit was very bad! Our fish tacos tasted very fishy. Probably they don't sell too much fish and it was going bad...( we'll be lucky if we don't get sick!!) Not to mention that is wasn't breaded and fried as the last time. Our shrimp tacos were lacking flavor and presentation. We felt that we paid too much for very little and bad product. It's a clear symptom of management trying to cut costs by under portioning and serving spoiled product. I don't see why to take this route when this place sells a lot. Not worthy to give them another chance. You get better tacos at a food truck than this pricey joint!More,October 2018,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60750-d13987684-Reviews-The_Taco_Stand-San_Diego_California.html

nnviekie,40.0,"I was here with 3 of my friends on Saturday night, June 24, 2017 at around 22:00 (10pm) after ballast point. My friend ordered carne asada burrito with sour cream and the rest of us ordered the California burrito with one of them guacamole and...sour cream.
The California burrito I had here was a bit different than the one's I had in the past. They use a different type of meat than the carne asada fries. I think the meat is dipped with enchilada sauce. I always had the misconception that the California burrito is carne asada fries with a burrito wrap. I know some of the Mexican restaurants like Lolita's, their California burrito is the basically carne asada fries in a burrito wrap.
Funny story: we ordered 3 California burrito and one of them had sour cream and guacamole. They incorrectly labeled the regular as the one with the sour cream and guacamole. I did not notice it until my friend was looking at me with his jealous eyes over the burrito I took from him. So a small (or maybe a big mistake) that they gave the wrong order out. My friend was too nice and I felt bad for eating his order. Hehe, I got lucky.
Back to the burrito I had, the meat was great. I liked the flavor, it was soft. The guacamole and sour cream was great too, but the enchilada sauce kind of wash it away a little bit. The fries on the burrito was a bit soggy at the end probably because the enchilada sauce was there. It is not a bad burrito though, but the fries certainly lost its crispy due to the moist of the other sauce. Overall though, it was a good burrito.
I had carne asada fries here about 2 months ago and I can say that I highly recommend it. Fries were crispy and it reminded me of the one's I had at Lolita's in Clairemont Mesa across the street from 99 Ranch Market. I still do favor the Lolita's carne asada fries a bit more than here though. Their salsa bar was great too and I see them refill their sauces very often. Overall, this is another one of the great places I would come for Mexican food and they have other items on the menu that I wanted to try.
The service here was great. Workers are friendly. The great thing about this place is that it is open 24 hours/7 days a week. For a great late night Mexican meal, it is one of the places to go on my list especially after my friends drinking at Ballast Point since it is not too far from there.

Cashiers make everyone's bagels, so...it takes forever. Cashiers should just take the order and the kitchen should make the bagels to keep the line moving. Finally got coffee and they were out of 1/2 and 1/2. Gave them the empty container and they forgot to fill it. Had to ask again after standing waiting for 5 min. After all the waiting the coffee tasted odd and bad. I've had Panera coffee and other locations with no issues. This location is terrible.

Fresh...thick, homemade tortillas overflowing with unique combinations of ingredients and flavorful sauces made us want to go back before we left town (which we did). Our first trip, I got two tacos with beans and rice and couldn't finish it all. The Famoso Taco was to die for (but not for anyone on a diet). Pan-fried cheese wrapped around sauteed steak, shrimp and onion... My only complaint was that the tacos were so fat, it got messy! Second time around I just got two tacos and that was still plenty.

This night I was looking for something different. I got a lot of different.  The burrito is excellent.  It's...enough for two people to be honest with you. Ice cold coke comes in a real glass bottle. The place always seems empty, but as I sat there, 3 or 4 people came and carried out huge orders. So, it looks to be a hidden neighborhood favorite. I prefer the picnic benches outside. It reminds me a little of Kansas City BBQ down in Seaport Village.

I can't describe how good the burritos are, with light beef, shrimp, and shoestring french fries smattered throughout. You just have to try it for yourself.More",October 2016,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60750-d10062873-Reviews-Famoso_Mexican_Street_Food-San_Diego_California.html

msubulldog25,30.0,"Stopped in on a Monday back in April, a little after the typical lunch hour. Place was mostly deserted... A table or two occupied in the gated sidewalk enclosure, nobody but me inside.

I picked the ""Street Taco Combo"" which came with rice and beans....Tacos had good toppings (guacamole, red onion, cilantro) but the meats were dry and under seasoned for my tastes. Served in a polystyrene container was a negative, especially for a dine-in order. Horchata was  good and large with a complimentary refill.

Overall, a pretty average experience. With tip & tax, lunch cost about $15. Decent meal, but not someplace I'd need to revisit.More",April 2016,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60750-d10062873-Reviews-Famoso_Mexican_Street_Food-San_Diego_California.html

Valleyblue,30.0,"The menu board gives you plenty of choices, that's for sure.  The sandwich I had was fine, but nothing you'd make a special trip for.  My sandwich did not come as ordered, which is a strike against them.  A big plus that more in their...favor--that more than cancels out the strike--is that they were extra careful when I advised them of a food allergy.  

But that's where it got strange.  I am allergic to garlic so I told them to leave off the aioli that was described as included.  The cashier taking my order said that she didn't think that there was garlic in the aioli and when she double checked, confirmed that the aioli indeed does NOT contain garlic, none of their aioli has garlic.  Aioli is literally garlic and olive oil (sometimes garlic and mayonnaise).  If it doesn't have garlic, it isn't aioli.  That's like pesto without basil.

Anyway, I'd go back to Which Wich, but not worth a special trip.  Maybe I'll see what faux aioli tastes like.More",October 2019,Which Wich Superior Sandwiches

BritsInABus,50.0,"We stopped off in San Diego to meet a friend on our way to spend 6 months in Mexico. She was horrified that we didn't have much experience of Mexican food so rushed us to the nearest Chipotle.

It was very busy but the line...moved quickly. 

As vegans, we often struggle to find something to eat in general restaurants but Chipotle gives you a wonderful choice. You start at one end of the counter and tell the servers what you want in your burrito or bowl as you move down. My friend directed us to the soy and the mild salsa, which were great choices. The onion/pepper mix was fabulous. The servers load them onto the burrito and wrap it up with such expertise that it makes you head spin.

I loaded up on the onion/pepper mix, whereas my daughter went easy on the spicy/hot stuff and asked for extra rice. No problem, you get exactly what you ask for.

There were unlimited fountain drinks as well as some high quality juices in the refrigerator.

Everything was fresh and smelled wonderful. The restaurant was very busy and it was easy to see why. Apart from the food being excellent, the place was very clean, and the staff members were friendly and helpful.

I would recommend Chipotle - and this branch in particular - to anyone who likes Mexican food, as well as people new to it, as it is a great introduction.

Unlimited toppings are available, but too much toppings makes your pizza a bit messy:))  Staff is very good at this...location and is located near many work facilities.

Robert I,50.0,"Pieology has a cool concept....thin crust pizza with whatever toppings you want for $8.45 for an 11.5 inch pizza. You stand in a cafeteria-style line and build your pizza as you move down the line. This can be time-consuming since some people do not seem...to be able to make up their minds. Once you have chosen your toppings, it takes about 10 minutes to cook your pizza. The employees were very friendly & helpful. Most importantly, the pizza was outstanding.

nnviekie,30.0,"My other friend was off from work late at night yesterday on July 3rd, 2017, so we decided to go to Cortixans for some late night dinner at around 22:00 (10pm). We ordered 3 California burritos with chicken and no pollo (I think tomato because...pollo is Spanish for chicken) for about $22. It was a busy night with 4 cars waiting in front of me when I arrived and perhaps 2 or 3 more on the other side of drive thru. Note that you can come in whichever direction and you'll see the drive through. There were also some tables filled with some people eating.
Anyways, the chicken and cheese was good. However I think I should have left the veggies there and not listen to my friend. I felt they gave the same portion amount of meat in and I liked veggies. The fries was okay though, they are not crispy. They get kind of soggy fast. Other than that, it was a good burrito. I can not complain. I had carne asada fries before here the previous times and I can say that the fries are okay too. It is not the best, but not that bad.
The service here was okay. Once a guy from the kitchen came up and handed the order to me, asked me if I paid. I replied and said ""Si"". He was looking at me weird. Then he was asking me if I wanted any sauce, I said okay. Then he said thank you. I said ""muchos gracias and muy amable"". Yes, I said that and he gave me a look. I laughed it off as I caught him by surprise that I am able to converse in Spanish. I don't know why they do not want to speak in Spanish to me when I am inviting them to.
Overall, I still do come here for the convenience of late night option to eat here. They open 24 hours/7 days a week. I think it is average for everything here, but it is better than some options out there.More",July 2017,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g32578-d4368937-Reviews-Cotixan_Mexican_Food-La_Jolla_San_Diego_California.html

fisherdvm,10.0,"Seems like highly rated Vietnamese restaurants often are not authentic.  Sad.  Had a bowl of Pho.  Noodle is fine.  Garnish fine - mint and bean sprouts.  Broth - horrendous.  The defining feature of Pho is the broth.  The original is beef stock.  They used chicken...stock for ALL the flavors.  Spices - star anise should stand out.  You can not taste it.  Coriander or cilantro, not taste it.  Ginger? None.  The supposed garnish as you please - hoisin and chili sauce became the flavor of the broth as they dump it into the flavorless broth to give color and taste!  It should be MY CHOICE to add hoisin or chili - not theirs.  What looks like Pho tasted like noodle in hoisin and chili broth.  Terrible!  It is what happens when non-Vietnamese runs a Vietnamese restaurant and think they know what the food should taste like.  This happens too much and people just do not know.More",February 2018,Food Shop

SimeyTravels,40.0,"This tiny little slip of a shop is connected to Sovereign Kitchen next door. They share the kitchen, though they don't share menus. I've dined at Sovereign a few times before, and enjoy the food and the comfortable chairs, but when I want something quick...that I can dash out the door with, I choose the shop next door.

The woman working the front is so super friendly. She's always very welcoming, and offers water while we wait (I think she does it for everybody, but I feel like she remembers that I was parched the first time we went in there, and that makes me feel special. Don't burst my bubble!)

On our first visit, we decided to eat in. Now, there were three of us, and we took up two tables by the front window, but that was fine for us. We each got a pho to try, and it's a good thing we ate in, because really, that dish doesn't travel well. The pho was very good, right up there with some of my other favorite pho shops in San Diego. She was very attentive that night, always making sure that we had enough napkins, water, or accoutrements. 

The next few times we stopped in, it was just the two of us, and we were getting meals to go. The only reason I'm taking a star off of the overall rating is because the to-go orders seemed to take a while to come out, on every occasion. She was apologetic every time, but that didn't make the food come out any faster.

Still, with everything else going in its favor, I can't be too upset by a bit of a wait (even if that ""bit"" is a bit more than a bit...) The food is always very tasty, and it fills us up without making us feel like we just ate our weight in dinner.

romyntheigorot,50.0,"Lolita's is the best place to get carne asada fries. I have been going here for so long and have definitely seen how the place has changed. (I also remember when carne asada fries used to be like $5-$7.) Crispy fries topped with carne asada,...guacamole, shredded cheese, sour cream, and queso fresco (or some sort of crumbled white cheese) just makes my mouth water. :)

Their California burrito is delicious as well. I think it's the way that they cook and season their carne asada and the cheese they use that makes their food taste good. 

There's a lot that you can park in and if that whole lot happens to get full then you can just park across the street in the other plaza lot. 

Cost - like $11-$12 but worth it. One full tray fed me and my partner and it's delicious. 

Wait time - probably like 15 minutes, depends on how many people are in front of you and they say that good food takes time (I'm paraphrase the phrase/motto that they have on their wall).

Joe G,30.0,"I've lived in the area since the middle 80's and have driven by this place hundreds of times. Now I know why.  I ordered one of the 'specialty"" burgers, the bacon  jalapeño cheeseburger and a large order of onion rings. Everything was cooked when ordered...and the burger was ok. Sufficiently warm and juicy with the extra jalapeños I ordered. The bacon wasn't cooked very crisp so that when I bit into the sandwich, the slightly undercooked bacon acted like a strip of rubber so that the sandwich was destroyed by the effort to bite through the bacon. I was impressed by the cleanliness of the young man who took and prepared my order. I watched him repeatedly wash his hands while cooking my order. My order was handed out to me by an older fellow that might have been Charlie. I looked in the bag to verify my order and questioned the older guy if the onion rings in the bag was actually a large order and he assured me that it was.  I left and on the way home I started snacking on the onion rings. YUCK!!  They were not hot, even though they were freshly cooked. I can only assume that they were frozen and not cooked long enough. They were like play dough.  I absolutely won't be going back.  The food is overpriced for the portion size and the quality of the food is less than average.

R. L,40.0,"Taco Fiesta is our go-to place for  Mexican food. It has a drive-thru and a walk-up window, with patio tables out front, though there's not much of a view, being right on Mission Gorge Road. The wait time is a bit on the slow side,...but that to me is a sign that the food is prepared after you order. 

The burritos are loaded with meat. I usually get the pollo asado, and it is muy heavy on the chicken. Not a lot of fillers either. My family likes the California burritos and the rolled tacos with real guacamole (be sure to specify this). Unlike the burritos, the fish tacos have maybe not enough fish and a bit too many extras, like shredded cabbage, tomatoes, and crema. They are still pretty tasty and run about $2.75 apiece, which is a bit steep. Prices here aren't cheap, but the food is authentic and the workers are friendly.More",March 2018,Taco Fiesta

I've frequented this restaurant for years and my last few visits have me completely put off. I'm not sure if there...was a change of ownership or cooks but I have definitely noticed a difference in the quality and preparation of their food. Their carne asada is overcooked and dry. If you're lucky it won't be burned. There's nothing worse than biting into a burrito with dry, crunchy-charred meat. Their rolled tacos hardly have any meat and are not crunchy like they should be. It also wouldn't hurt to put a bit more of that watered-down guacamole on it.

One read ""A short stranger will soon enter your life with blessings to share"" which sounds too much like Twin Peaks for comfort.  The second read ""Someone is looking up to you.

Scott G,50.0,"I may be a white boy, but my taste buds are 100% Mexican. I was born and raised on this kind of food in Southern California, and I know what is authentic and I also know what is just one step above Taco Bell. This...place is most definitely NOT Taco Bell - this is top of the line authentic!

The first thing that will strike is the friendliness of the crew - they always are delighted that you have joined them for a meal, and they are excited to show you how delicious their food is. A kitchen that you can see into? All to show that quality is always visible, every moment they are cooking. As for myself, I love to sit at the counter with a view into the kitchen. Watching the tortillas being handmade and lovingly cooked is a treat, as is the care being made every step of the way with whatever is being prepared.

As for the food, here is the highest compliment I can give Mexican food: it doesn't really need salsa. The flavors of every meat speak for themselves - they are all incredible, and they have been every time I have been. Consistency is the key to any restaurant's success, and I leave each time thinking, ""when is the next time I can come back?"" However, if you are wondering, of COURSE there is a salsa bar...and it's quite good, too!

The location is extremely easy to access from the 805 freeway, both north and south, as it is right next to the freeway interchange. Parking, however, can be problematic: there are many other businesses in this mini-mall, and the landlord is restricting where people can park for each business. This place does a lot of business, so parking at peak hours can be dicey, and they are cracking down hard on patrons using spots not designated for this place.

A lot of southern California Mexican food has a ""sameness"" about it - Taqueria Revolucion is different. The passion that makes Mexican food so vibrant lacking elsewhere is definitely found here. It is truly the real deal.More",April 2018,Taqueria Revolucion

vagabondginger,30.0,"I had worked a Coastal Cleanup event and received a card to redeem at Rubio's for free guac & chips. Now I needed a full lunch so I ordered the Langostino Lobster Bowl which was beautifully served with rice, black beans, romaine and guacamole &...a couple of small flour tortillas.  And I got a bottle of Mexican beer. The chips & guac were free yet the order was still over $18 with tax on which I did not tip. Ordering at a counter like McDonald's should not be that expensive for Mexican food. I had planned to sit outside but right after I ordered we had a sudden downpour of rain for about 1/2 hour so I was forced to sit inside. At least it wasn't very busy. This just wasn't the kind of atmosphere that I would pay $18 for lunch again. I like more sit down and be served meals.More",November 2020,Rubio's

Two seconds later, the front clerk comes to see, but kept my eyes on the cook. He casually grabs a tortilla and continues to ""cook."" I mentioned this to the front clerk and all she does is apologize. I even told her the cook saw me see him and instead of going and wash his hands, he's continuing touching food.

darkhorse2821,40.0,"QUICKIE REVIEW
Quality food at a reasonable price.

FOOD
This is what I tried:

-INDULGE Fatteh Shawarma
-Moutabel

I have to say, if you really want the best of both worlds go with INDULGE Fatteh Shawarma.    It just does not look appetizing, it is delicious....While taking a pic of it, the aroma from the food just hits you and makes you want it even more.  The pita chips on the bottom are cooked perfectly where they are not hard but has the perfect balance of crispiness and being soft.   Mixing everything together really is a treat.

Moutabel was tasty as well.  I would recommend getting a side of warm pita to go with it as I felt that complimented it.  If you like eggplant and you are good with a creamy texture, you will love this.   

PARKING
Yes, it is in a strip plaza.

SERVICE
You order at the counter and pick up at the counter.  Pretty straight forward.

If you get a chance to meet and talk with Nawar (owner), do it.   He is willing to talk about and break down everyone on the menu.    The man has a passion for his business and you definitely feel that when speaking with him. 

PRICE
Highest price items for a bowl/plate is $12.50.   Well worth it for the quality of the food.

TIP/OTHER THOUGHTS
While speaking with Nawar, there was a common theme I picked up: fresh and made in house.   From the presentation and taste of everything, I would have to agree.  

I did notice a steady flow of customers coming in (I was there at 6:40 pm ish) but at no point was there an outrageously long line.   Meaning you could come here whenever and be served in a timely manner.

Next time I would like to try their signature shawarmas as they are supposed to be lighter than the plate/bowl I had.More",February 2019,Simsim Mediterranean Grill
penelopeonetwo,50.0,"A friend of ours recommended the food here and we were not disappointed.  We spoke to Ibrahim, the chef and owner for recommendations.

F8258FIalia,50.0,Probably the best shawarma in San Diego in my opinion. I had the daring shawarma and it was really good. The feta shawarma is also a dish that is unique and very flavorful. I even can’t find that dish in the Middle East. It is...a must tryMore,August 2018,Simsim Mediterranean Grill
EuropeCosmicTravel,40.0,"I was excited for this place to open and was dying to hopefully taste a great schwarma sandwich like the ones I’ve eaten on the East Coast and Europe. The place is new so still working out the kinks. There plenty of servers but they...still seemed a bit overwhelmed when a large group and other customers all came in at once. I had the SimSim and the wonderful garlic mayo is just as I remembered. I ordered mine without the potatoes inside and while they do have arugula or parsley, I would have like the chopped romaine offered at other places for the filler. With out the potatoes it doesn’t really look like much but it was still good. Subbed hummus for the fries and that seemed to cause confusion. At one point they were putting fries on my plate even though I asked for it without. I also had to ask for more pita for the hummus as they only gave me 2 triangles. My food got cleared without asking when I went to get my drink refilled, but the man behind the counter replaced the hummus I hadn’t eaten. 

Staff was friendly, and I don’t mind a small up charge for something other than fries in the side. For folks who are trying to skip carbs, it would be great if they would offer the romaine instead of potatoes in the wraps and maybe veggies instead of pita for the dips.

Overall I will definitely be back as the food was good. Hopefully they will have worked out a few more of their kinks by then.More",September 2018,Simsim Mediterranean Grill
S M,50.0,"Seriously the best shawarma I've tried in San Diego! The meat is tender and full of flavor. The ingredients in the wrap I ordered were so fresh and clean. They make their hummus by soaking the garbanzo beans overnight (the chef told us that). We...ordered a couple of wraps, a bowl and a plate with their 4 sides. All were excellent. You can tell they use high quality ingredients because when you leave, you feel great! I love the ambiance. It's clean, modern, open and full of light. The staff was very friendly and asked us how we were doing. We'll definitely return as this will be a regular spot for us!More",September 2018,Simsim Mediterranean Grill
bo7maid,50.0,"In a single word, superb. The shawarma is second to none, as both the beef and chicken were absolutely finger licking good. I also tried the bulgur and the rice which were phenomenal. All the veggies were as fresh as fresh can be, and they...really come out in the fattoush salad. (The garlic sauce is a must regardless of what shawarma/plate you choose)

The interior and decor are that of an upscale restaurant and for the prices being charged, there is no restaurant that even comes close to SimSim. This place is miles away from all the other Middle-Eastern eateries out there. 

The owners are beyond kind and courteous and have spared no expense in this fine establishment.More",September 2018,Simsim Mediterranean Grill
Scalifor B,50.0,"Middle Eastern food has always been tricky in the US, because the taste and quality that I search for doesn’t exist. During my trip to Lebanon, I realized that food in the Middle East tastes completely different than the US. The food is really tasty,...and you can feel all the spices and fresh ingredients. The Middle Eastern immigrants never brought the real taste from the Middle East to the US. There were a lot of OK Middle Eastern restaurants and for a very long time they were the best available. Today there is a restaurant that is a total game changer in the industry. It is called Simsim Outstanding Shawarma and surprisingly their first branch is in San Diego, California. When you first see the branch, the first thing that comes to mind that this restaurant chain has lots of branches, because of how professional the business is being ran. When it comes to design which is really impressive, and it looked very luxury and upper scale. When you first see the design, the first assumption that comes to mind that this restaurant is very expensive, but it isn’t the case. Their prices ranges between $8-$11, which is inexpensive compared to the design and aesthetics of the place. Simsim Outstanding Shawarma has an executive chef behind the concept and he is delivering the authentic taste to the US. All their meats are Halal, which is the type of meat that is clean. I kind of see it as Kosher, but another term for the same practice. Now let me tell you about the items I had today.

The first item is the simsim shawarma, which has chicken, pomegranate, diced potato, parsley & garlic Sauce. The shawarma tasted perfectly when I got extra sauce on the side and started to dip. They suggest getting extra sauce on the side for those who like more sauce. The combination of chicken and pomegranate is very unique, and it is really unbelievable. When I ate the simsim shawarma, which is the signature shawarma for Simsim Oustanding Shawarma. I said hands down to the best shawarma in San Diego (Simsim – Chicken & Pomegranate)

The second sandwich we got was the Casual Falafel. It was very tasty sandwich, and again it taste much better when you get Tahini on the side.

The third dish we got was a recommendation and it is called Indulge Feta Shawarma. This dish is very unique and really tasty. I only got the beef & lamb, no chicken.

The last thing which is very interesting is the Hummus. At simsim they call Hummus their Guac, and it makes total sense. Their Hummus is very tasty and goes well with everything, and it doesn’t have that after taste. It appeared that they sprout it in house, and it isn’t canned chickpeas.

simsim is setting a new standard in the food industry, and for now it is the tastiest Shawarma in San Diego.More",August 2018,Simsim Mediterranean Grill

It can be take out or eaten on their sidewalk tables outside.  It's a bit do-it-yourself, but when you taste their creations, wow.  And they have all their great meats (beef, pork, chicken, duck, sausages, etc.) for sale in their shop so you can make your favorite dish as well.  Grass-fed is a trademark for their meats.  They also offer local craft brewery beers to meet just about everyone's taste.  This is a phenomenal experience to let your taste buds go wild with the best ever.  Service is friendly and down to earth.  You get to be among the first to see where they are going with this concept.  This is definitely one of a kind.

This combined operation will become a mainstay of San Diego and they are already planning extensions.  It's worth your time to visit, eat in or take out.  Each month they also sponsor a street fair next to the shop (3rd Friday night) to enjoy local fast foods.More",June 2016,the Heart and Trotter

Entering the restaurant, I received a friendly greeting from the worker behind the counter. She recommended the ""Taco Especial."" This was a taco with shrimp, fish, scallops.

Cecilia S,50.0,"Best cheesesteaks in town?! You better believe it! ERRR-MA-GAAAAAAD

A friend from Jersey recommended Gorgino's to us. He raves about their cheesesteaks and pork rolls. First of all, I don't quite remember what life was like before I tried pork rolls, but they are kind...of life changing...

Now you may be asking, what in the world are pork rolls??? If you're not from Jersey (which I'm not), you may be thinking pork rolls are like a porchetta sandwich (at least that's what I was thinking of)?? But in fact, pork rolls are like the California burritos of SoCal. It's essentially an amazing breakfast sandwich (like imagine ham, but better). I personally loved the Egg Roll Sandwich (not to be confused with like a Chinese eggroll). It's delicious, probably an amazing hangover food, and it just hits the right spot. YUM! And per my Jersey friends, Gorgino's is the only place in San Diego that makes it. 

Ok, now back to the cheesesteaks. The key to an amazing cheesesteak comes from the roll. It has to be the right kind of roll. Luckily, Gorgino's gets their bread straight from Philly.  Oh the cheese.. the thinly sliced steak.. the bread... it's perfection.  

Not going to lie, they have a pretty substantial menu with lots of delicious options. But I'm a creature of habit, so I either only get the cheesesteak or the pork rolls. It never disappoints.

T D,30.0,"First off, I will try them again. By the other reviews, this may have been just a fluke mishandling of the product, causing a sub-par batch or part of a batch. I so wanted to be impressed!

My generous sample spoon of chocolate ice cream...was mostly joined ice crystals. This can happen during production, but may just have been a re-freeze incident—the top of the tub appeared very soft. The favor lacked a distinct chocolate component  and was just cloying sweet. I was expecting a premium or super-premium ice cream, but since the staff did not know what ""butterfat"" was, much less the percentage, I am not going to guess.

The staff are knowledgable and helpful and the owner was there when we visited too....We ordered two pizzas - the vegetable one with their own pea-zza sauce and the pepperoni pizza with tomato sauce. We tried the whole grain crust with brown rice protein and I am shocked that I actually found it more flavourful than a standard white pizza crust. It wasn’t dry or dense at all. It was delicious. Both pies were amazing. The pizza packed more than 50g of protein, perfect post workout. 

We were greedy and also tried two smoothies and two kombuchas. The tropical smoothie tasted like a pina colada, while the date smoothie tasted dark and rich. The kombucha flavours (on tap as any hipster place has) we’re both awesome.

hawaiijohnson1,50.0,"About a year ago, I accidentally found this place while driving in the area, and decided to check it out. I had been to this store chain, and was pleasantly surprised to find great bakery items, freshly made tamales, various salsas, and hot food. Being...picky about baked goods and not having much success in the past with grocery store cakes, I hesitated to buy my daughter’s birthday cake from here. I have to say that the chocolate cake with a white cream frosting was amazing. The cream was light and evenly spread between rich, moist, dense layers of cake, and was topped off with a few berries...yum! Bought some tamales as well, which was made right behind the counter. Took those home with some delicious chicharones and had a really good and cheap lunch. Went to the market again yesterday and did not leave disappointed. Bought pastries, cornbread (which was almost dense like a bread pudding and filled with corn pieces), fresh salsa, guacamole (freshly made on Monday and Wednesdays), and chips, dessert (fried flour tortilla) chips, rice pudding, fried rice, and 3 types of hot tamales. Our piecemeal lunch was the best! If or when, I’m definitely going back again...probably today, lol.More",August 2018,Gonzalez Northgate Market

OKAY,it's 1:30 in the morning at this point what can we do? The Philly cheese was just ok but the portion was really small like half a small order of a child size fries.

Michael P,40.0,"Nestled in the old town of La Mesa, where you pay to park if you can find a spot unless it is after 6 pm, is a quaint coffee shop called Cosmos Coffee Cafe.  Décor resembles the sixties beatnik type establishment although the staff and...patrons are clearly modern dress.  The staff was friendly and full of giggles as they performed their necessary duties.  Politics was not even on the list of discussions.  The coffee was extra hot the way it is brewed best.  The laptops and other wifi devices were abundant and in full use.  People were walking the sidewalks of this old town clearly looking for an open establishment. A sincere gentleman came in and sits up his guitar to play for our entertainment.  A most welcome surprise as it was not beatnik music but country and contemporary music of the 50s, 60s and 70s.  It was a shame the good times had to end for that day.More",July 2015,Cosmos Coffee Cafe

They also have 3 sauces for dipping so be sure to try those.  I LOVED the marinara and it goes with all the flavors.
