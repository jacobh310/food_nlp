X460LOandrewc,50.0,"Excellent service. The Pilsner beer is light and refreshing. Three of us ate with two beers for under $50. 

How people can say this restaurant is slightly above a McDonald’s blows my mind!

The super burger with bacon and cheese was awesome. Fresh patties, toasted...bun and fresh pickles, lettuce and tomato. 

For the price, I was in heaven. 

Will definitely return if we’re in the area.More",March 2020,Super Duper Burgers
monicavernet,30.0,"Definitely this is not my place. I like well done and quality burgers but this place it is more like a fast food chain.

It is true that if you compare it to mcdonalds or something similar, the super duper burger has more quality. They...also claim everything is gmo free and everything is madre freshly every day.

Unfortunately we will not repeat again.More",December 2019,Super Duper Burgers

bluestravelerz,50.0,"When u are lonely...you can always go downtown! 

There i said it in my SUPER DUPER burgers TripAdvisor post.

Super Duper gave me some gift cards after I posted on Yelp.

This Super Duper is on Market Street in the Fidi..and you cannot miss it...a skip.

Get a burger, maybe with cheese...get a mini burger..and a shake..or soft serve ice cream..Don't forget..the side pickles for free.

Don't forget to offer GOOD PICKLES!!

Hajir S,50.0,"If you want a relatively fast meal, at not too high of a cost, but high quality Super Duper is the way to go. No it's not going to be a gourmet eating experience that you might get from a fancy restaurant, but the burger,...shakes, fries, even salads are way better than so much of the food you're eating in the area, at a much better price. You can add mushroom, jalapenos, avocado and lots of other yummy additions to your burger to make it that much better!

Honestly no reason to get a fast food burger with Super Duper around!More",January 2020,Super Duper Burgers

We also tried Mustang Relish and added the vegan egg, also super good!! The vegan egg was quite convincing. Seaweed Fries were yum, perfect size and crispiness. Tried the vegan soft serv, very strong flavour, different from other vegan ice cream I've had, but good! Their online ordering system could use some improvements, it was a bit tricky to make order adjustments but thankfully our food was correct and the crew was very professional!

CL2018,50.0,"These type of spots often get mixed into one Hype-Cycle or another.  Especially in SF, GMO Free, Vegetarian, Vegan, Plant-Based (anything) tend to draw-in trendy crowds.  In the case of VeganBurg...none of that matters.

These folks are the real-deal.  The burgers are simply amazing.  Its...pretty easy to get into an argument with yourself on which Burger is your favorite...my current Fav is the Haight 'n Salsa (Fresh avocado, GMO-free crispy plant-protein patty, hand-crafted pico de gallo, white onion marinated with lemon juice, fresh cilantro & creamy vegan aioli)...but this is subject to change based on my next visit ;)

The 100% plant-based patties are outstanding and come across as a perfectly spiced medium-firm meatloaf if cut rounded.  The flavors are unique and tend to compel mindfulness as you process the unique flavors and textures each burger has to offer.

My one caveat would be that a Burger, Small Fry, & a Pellegrino Mineral Water will set you back $20.... so when compared to other meal options VeganBurg is premium priced.

I could not think of a better place for these people to set-up shop an open SF minds than The Haight.... Hope they will be with us for many years to come.More",June 2019,Veganburg

ellesenoj,40.0,"I ate here two different time when I was in San Francisco. The first time I got the frings (half garlic fries, half onion rings) and a veggie burger. It was all great, minus the bun. I have to echo what some people have said...about the bun being too big and just not on par with the rest of the food. However, it seemed like some really liked it and those were the ones that seemed to get the specialty burgers so the next time I got the Spicy Sly with the veggie patty. I agree that the bun does soak up the juices from the sauce but I really didn't care for the Spicy Sly. It is pricey, but it is definitely on point with everywhere else and I feel like I got more food. All in all, I would definitely return if I'm back in the area, but I'll hope the bun has changed.More",January 2020,Pearl's Deluxe Burgers

They give you the option of how you want it cooked, but they aren't mincing their own beef, and next to the wall menu is a sign advising you not to eat rare or uncooked meat, so they are clearly not confidant that their meat isn't seething in bacteria......if your in SF and want a decent burger go to Super Duper on market or Napa valley burger company in sausalito  if you can travel. either way you'd be better not going to Pearls.More",October 2019,Pearl's Deluxe Burgers

eltravelnotes,30.0,"This is more about the current safety measures they have in place.  I went during the day on a weekday so it wasn't too crowded.  But in my recent experience, I found the place too lax on the safety rules regarding the current environment and...indicates to me that they aren't being taken seriously:

1. An employee opens the door for you, which means you don't have to touch the door, which is great, but he stands in a way where you have to pass within a foot of him.

2. Very lax on mask measures.  You're technically required to wear a mask to go in, but I saw many with masks only covering their mouths (and not their noses), and taking it on and off as they stood waiting for their food.  There was one person who wasn't wearing a mask at all and several employees passed by him and did not say anything. 

3. The cashiers lean around the plastic barrier to speak to you, which defeats the purpose of the barrier.

4.  As you wait for your food, the employees walking around make no effort to distance themselves as they pass by though there is a lot of room around you.  So you're constantly dodging people.

This was an uncomfortable experience and makes me hesitant to return anytime soon.More",July 2020,In-N-Out Burger

aaronazzap,30.0,"The taste of these burgers are gorgeous. The size of the food is average but prices are quite high for what you get.
The problem with this restaurant is the location. Good for the venue's revenue but bad for the customer. The three times we...visited it was very busy with wait times to be served and food provided ate into the whole lunch hour which is not good. Very poor queue management and very poor execution of delivering the food. Too many silly conversations could be heard from the kitchen staff standing about instead of cooking the food for the ever increasing queues of customers.

Stephen R,30.0,"I recently visited San Francisco along with my sister and her husband. My brother who lives there , was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. We stayed at his apartment and about 9:30 pm went to bed. We talked for a little while with his...wife and left around 10:00 pm. We stayed at the Argonaut Hotel on the Fisherman’s Wharf which is a very nice place. An In & Out Burger is only a block or so from our hotel so we decided to go there. It was jam packed at 10:15 pm - mostly young high school aged or college students. There’s very little seating inside, so we resigned ourselves to eating outside. Luckily a table emptied so we grabbed it. We all ordered cheeseburgers, one fry and drinks. It came to over $20.00. The burgers were just ok, the fry so-so and a drink is a drink. We were all disappointed after hearing about how good In & Out was. It’s average at best.... I was in once and will stay out !!More",February 2020,In-N-Out Burger
aeltradv,30.0,"We were told we couldn’t come to San Francisco without trying an In ‘N’ Out. We got off the boat from Alcatraz (12:45-ish) and headed straight to In-N-Out - a few minutes walk away.

We were pleasantly surprised to find there was no queue to...order food when we arrived and only about 10 people waiting for food. There was a shortage of tables, but we managed to get one while waiting for our food to be ready (up to 15 minutes, maybe).

We bought 1 cheeseburger combo (a cheeseburger, fries and a drink) and an extra cheeseburger and a drink. This cost us $16.17 - a bargain.

The cheeseburgers were great. The fries were plenty big enough to share, though a little disappointing. It tasted like they’d either been cooked from frozen too quickly, or perhaps hadn’t been given long enough to cook. 

Despite being busy, the place was spotless. Someone was wiping down tables every time a new party sat down.

I don’t think you’d get a sit down lunch for less in this area. The burgers were good, the wait was short, and the place seemed clean.More",February 2020,In-N-Out Burger

The food was superb and our fish, chips and shrimps were clearly cooked to order and were piping hot.  For San Francisco the prices were extremely reasonable and even with a well deserved 15% tip we felt we were still well ahead.  There is nothing fancy about this place just wonderful food served in baskets with salt, pepper and ketchup on the tables.  For anyone who likes fabulous food, in a non “posey” setting cooked and served the traditional way this place is a must.

Even with that, we ended up taking MOST of the pizza home on BART.  It is a nice area in North Beach so it was nice with the sunshine.  If you walk around the corner down the street, there is a nice grassy area in front of the church in North Beach - just pack a picnic blanket!  It was $26.50 for the huge sheet of pizza and there is still some left in the freezer.More",January 2021,Golden Boy Pizza
eudaimonictraveler,50.0,"After hearing about Golden Boy Pizza, I decided to drop by during my visit to San Francisco. As I reached the restaurant, I saw people waiting in line around 9 pm. So, there was a short wait before I could place my order. Since they...had limited vegetarian options, I picked up two slices of their Pesto Veggies. I got my order served right away. I knew after the first bite that this was one of the best pizzas I've ever had. It was delicious! The topping had an assortment of olives, onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, and zucchini with gracious amounts of cheese. The crust looked thick, but it felt light and had a crispiness to it. I found the portion for one pizza slice sufficient for a meal. I enjoyed every bite of the pizza! The restaurant has its walls full of stickers, which gives it an old-school vibe. The restaurant was cash only during my visit. I hope they now have more payment options. It's best to check with them before you visit the restaurant. Their service was quick, and their staff was helpful with my queries. It was the first time I had a pizza in the shape of a square. All the walking I did to reach the restaurant was worth it. I'll always remember and cherish the pizza I had from Golden Boy Pizza. I hope I have the chance to visit them in the future.More",March 2020,Golden Boy Pizza

rohanpillai1,50.0,You'll have to wait in line to get a slice of pizza. I waited for around 40 mins on a Saturday night. But the wait was worth it. It is quite inexpensive too. Would totally recommend.,February 2020,Golden Boy Pizza

David P,30.0,"Stopped by with a colleague for a slice of pizza.  The line was short when we arrived, with only 2-3 people ahead of us, but it still took over 10 minutes to get a slice of pizza.  The pizza itself was good, though not exceptional....The pizza sheets are cut into 12 squares, and when you order, the employee puts your pizza into an oven to heat it up.  The pizza comes out piping hot.

If I were in the neighborhood, I would come back, but I probably wouldn’t go out of my way to go to Golden Boy.  The employees are great, but the system of ordering, warming and receiving the pizza could use some workflow updates.  There is limited seating inside, so plan accordingly if the weather is less than ideal.  It is $3.50-$4.50 per slice, so quite reasonable.  Pizza is above average, the process of getting the pizza and the building/restaurant itself below average, so average overall.More",January 2020,Golden Boy Pizza
RobertG2487,10.0,"Food tastes worse than McDonald's. You can get a MUCH better pizza at dominos than this place. Staff is EXTREMELY rude and curses at customers. When I asked a question about my order they refused to answer my question, told me to figure it out...myself, and order my ""f*cking pizza"" when I'm ready. They refused to tell me their names, the two managers were the worst business owners I've ever seen in my life. Danon and Amanda are the ones I spoke to and they cursed at me and told me to ""get a life"" when I happened to be upset by them swearing at me. If you want to ruin your night by being treated like scum and eating cheap pizza that tastes like paper, this is your place. Otherwise, look elsewhere.More",January 2020,Golden Boy Pizza
Kal_elen,10.0,"My partner and I had Googled ‘vegan pizza in San Francisco’ and this eatery came up on one list. We weren’t too far away so ventured over.

Upon arrival, my partner asked the woman serving about vegan options only to be met with a quite...rude and aggressive “No”. My partner mentioned that we’d been directed here via Google. The woman’s response to this was “We have never served vegan pizza and NEVER will.” It was an uncomfortable exchange.

We couldn’t understand the hostility and the server’s general manner, but needless to say we moved on.

jyee5127,50.0,"Best Take out Vietnamese sandwiches on Larkin St  in tenderloin area of downtown SF. Very seedy area with street people, but well worth the trip.  I like the grilled pork and grilled chicken.  Will try the meatball sandwich next time.  When it’s your turn, shout...out the Order, and mine were ready in less than 5 minutes.  

Don’t go here for warm and fuzzy service, it wont happen. Only 3 seating inside, its noisy and chaotic, best sandwich with fresh veggies, secret sauce, on a great perfect roll. I ask for “ no peppers” and they won’t put in jalapeños peppers.  I ask “ cut in half” and they will. Cash Only. Be ready to order when it’s your turn.  

Best $4 sandwich anywhere, fresh , tasty and filling.  
Ignore the beggars and street people, walk there with a purpose, you will be fine. I always buy an extra sandwich, for late night snack or lunch tomorrow.  

Hint.  I was riding in Uber car, my driver dropped me off, five people in line, it moves fast,  and driver circled back when I was ready.  Parking nearly impossible there.  I bought him a $4 sandwich as his tip- he was thrilled.  Best money ever spent.

chanyu1,30.0,"This place used to have one of the best Vietnamese sandwich with an excellent price but my most recent experience has revealed that the sandwich has slipped a bit in terms of quality. Before,  the roast pork sandwich had decent tasting meat but this time,...the pork was dry and chunky, making the sandwich even more chewy than before. I've never care for the bread at this place as I feel that their sandwiches would be 100% better if their bread is not so chewy but at least the meat was nice and soft. But now,  even the meat is chewy making eating this sandwich an exercise for the jaw.

When I contacted them to share, and ask for a refund, they completely ignored my message.  So I then disputed the charge on my card, stating I didn't get what I ordered.  Super Duper actually fought that!  So I don't care how good your food is, if you are THAT horrible on your customer service - esp. in the current environment - you don't deserve ANYONE'S business.  

Sure, you can still go and hope you don't have any issues, but reconsider just because they are so shady and customer unfriendly!More",May 2020,Super Duper Burgers

mtzennmaster,40.0,"I know, we don't come to San Francisco for lean and tasty try-tip, we come for fresh Crab or maybe clam chowder in a boudin sourdough bread bow.  Anyway we were all out walking and the smell waifing out of Buckhorn Grill was hard to...resist.  I am glad that I didn't. I had the Roadhouse Buck and was so pleased with the quality of the meat, the flavor, and the amount, that I went back again another evening.  There is plenty more, if trip-tip isn't your thing, they had a very nice clam chowder, not to thick or heavy, filled with clams and big chunks of potato. I will be back.More",July 2019,Buckhorn Grill

Tammy D,40.0,"(Buckhorn Grill – SF 845 Market Location- In the Westfield City Centre Shopping Mall food court..845 Market Street, San Francisco, CA )

It's difficult, but not impossible to find a decent meal in SF for less than $20.  I go to The City often and...I eat at City Centre every time because even if I want steak and my companions prefer vegan, the Westfield food court can please us all.  Don't turn up your nose at the idea of eating food court cuisine, especially if you are on a budget and would rather spend money seeing the sites of SF instead of paying $50 for crab sushi in one of the upscale dives.
All the sandwiches I have had were excellent, with the tri-tip being my favorite.   I also enjoy their Roadhouse and tri-tip salads.  If I am really  hungry, I will order a barbecue plate with mashed potatoes and veggies on the side.

My average tab is around $16, including drink.   You really can't get this kind of filling, protein-intense meal for less anywhere in the City.     Enjoy! 

There are several Buckhorn Grills in the greater Bay Area and Sacramento.  I have eaten at 3 of them and they've all been very good quality and reasonably-priced.More",September 2018,Buckhorn Grill

I looked on tripadvisor for tips, and this little place came up, with great reviews. I was curious to see...what Italian food looked like in SF, so I gave it a go, and I have been very pleased with it!

I chose a sandwich called Italiano (or something along these lines) with LOTS of different types of cold meat, and cheese. You also have the option of putting greens in, but I politely declined :) 
The owner is very friendly, too, which is lovely. 

I went for a small sandwich - which was actually HUGE ! I think a small size is actually ok for most people, any bigger would be just too much.

This store is not far from the pier and the seafront, so on a nice day people can actually walk over and enjoy their panini by the water - which is what I did!

Tom C,50.0,"As a ""hook line"" JUST GO this was simply amazing, honest  food in a vibrant down to earth environment and a solid price point. The menu is short and to the point which added in everything we had being outstanding. The wings which included the...crispy tips were spicy with a nice crunch (passed the fork test) but what I found unique was you can still taste (in traditional taste but also texture) the dry rub as it's not lost in the sauce.
A staple of any chicken joint is of course their fried chicken burger, the softest bun encased the most tender chicken allowing all the sauce and flavour of each bite to blend together smoothly in the mouth meaning you got a bit of everything everytime. A lovely heat throughout not a spike you sometimes get all due to this was rounded off with a little ranch and pickles and it was next to perfect 
Now fries aren't usually my thing I can take them or leave them but the loaded curly fries took me back to my childhood with just the classic curly fry flavour made more adult with the bacon, spring onion and sour cream.
Lastly my time in the states got me falling in love with the ""biscuit"" and the chicken biscuit here was also an amazing biscuit, one of the best I've had. Great crunch to the outside but so soft inside , had a layer of sweetness from some cinnamon in the mix made this interesting and unique.

My experience yesterday left me as cold as my Falafel Sandwich did.
I saw one person write of a ""$$"" scam on another review site.
My Falafel was $7.95 + .68 (tax) + $1.29 (tip) = $9.92. No scam here, straight up price. My decision to leave a tip, which I should not have done.

All things considered, when I responded to ""how was my experience"" from my email receipt, I did not write a glowing review, as you can imagine.
Within a few minutes, the owner wrote back, apologized profusely and said they are in the process of hiring new help, training staff and all around doing a better job, especially in the cleanliness factor of the tiny walk up.

All I can say is, give it some time, maybe try it again.

Cherry_Wonderdog,40.0,"Very nice, no-thrills, Vietnamese“fast food” that’s a welcome alternative to Moscone Center boxed lunches for folks who are attending industrial tradeshows but not seeking industrialized food. I was treated here by a colleague and was impressed by the variety of fresh vegetable and noodle choices...available for my “bowl”.  After deep soul searching, I ended up combining crispy tofu with lettuce, bean sprouts, cilantro, cucumber, crispy shallots, pickled veggies, and jalapeno peppers on vermicelli. To my disappointment, the “crispy tofu” actually consisted of four large airy pieces rather than smaller marinated stir-fry pieces that I had received at the Bibibop Asian Grill in Columbus. As a result, I was a bit envious of my more seasoned Freshroll colleague who had chosen the spicy pork that she loved and couldn’t even finish. On the other hand, I thoroughly enjoyed a side of their all-natural chicken pho broth, with white onions, cilantro, and scallions. 

There were tables outside, but since it was a bit cold, we ate on a somewhat wobbly table inside which required our own cleaning. Yes, it was cramped, as we needed to get up on a couple occasions when someone tried to get past. Fortunately, the meal was quite yummy and value-priced.

Their burritos are spectacular. Carne asada, carntias, chicken, and all the ingredients of the ginormous burritos.

skattch,40.0,"I used to work in downtown SF and when I did I would go to the Oasis Grill at least once every week  or two for their chicken schwarma. Man, I love that middle-eastern burrito. 

Do not be dismayed if you go at lunchtime and...there is a line out the door. First, that line is there for a reason, the food is great. Second, there is almost no room inside so it is not as long as it looks. Finally,  it moves fast and is totally worth the wait.

While the food is great, what amazes me most is the staff.  I don't know his name but the main guy there as been behind that counter for years and I swear if you were there once before, he remembers you. 

I always get my chicken schwarma with extra sauce and easy on the spice. It is especially good if you have them add a little feta on there for some salty goodness. 

Enjoy!

The order arrived missing many items from our order and the items that were received were not even made according to our order. They...never sent 2 mill shakes, 2 fries, several burgers etc. And when I phoned to find out what happened to my order, I was a bit upset and irate, they said that they didn’t see one item on their iPad. And I said yeah that’s one item, a burger, but what about all the other missing items. They had no answer. They then said because of the order though door dash, they couldn’t give a refund. I wanted to bring the food back. They instead said they would give me a gift card, not like I want to go back, and they asked how much I’d like it for. I said the full amount. I don’t want this fouled food. She said she would call me back after calling a manger of sorts to confirm that she can make one for that amount. She didn’t think she could. I thought that Then she should offer several to make up the amount. I never received a call and at 8:30, 1/2 hour before close, I phoned back. I was speaking with another rep who picked up the phone explaining and I was disconnected. I tried calling back for the next half hour and they never picked up the phone nor called me back.

magicconnch,30.0,"While traveling I always ask for recommendations on spots to eat, I wanted a slice, and I told this was the place to come. Overall my experience was pretty average at best. The walls are adorned with ""autographs"" from Celebs, trying to achieve a true...NY feel I suppose. It was relatively slow when I got in so I was able to get my order in quickly. The customer service was decent enough, I wasn't looking for anyone to go above and beyond by any means. They had a variety of different types of Pizza which was nice, however I opted to stick with the classic pep, which may have been a mistake, as it was one of the last slices that was out, so I'm not sure how long it had been out. The pizza came out fairly quick, it was pretty average, again maybe it was sitting out for a while, so it wasn't as fresh, but for the price and hype, I expected a better slice. I would maybe try it again, depending on the freshness of slice, however it was not my favorite while in SF.More",November 2019,Escape From New York Pizza

JamesH6271126,20.0,"There were a couple of pizza places in the vicinity of our hotel, and the staff recommended this one.  When we got there, it was small and somewhat shabby looking, but we've gotten good meals in worse-looking places before, so we decided to try it....There was a price list for slices, but nothing about whole pizzas, which is what we wanted, so I walked up to the counter to get more information.  I was greeted with, ""What do you want?""  I ignored the rudeness and explained that we had never been there before, and I wanted to know what was available (and the prices).  The employee looked around and finally found a well-worn menu.  
We ordered a pizza and a salad.  The salad was apparently pre-made, and came in a plastic container.  I had to ask for plates and forks.  When the pizza finally came (it took a while) it was pretty undistinguished.  It tasted OK, but there was nothing at all special about it.  I know it's SF, and everything is more expensive, but I was looking for a little quality, and failed to find it.  
We didn't ask the hotel staff for any more recommendations.More",May 2019,Escape From New York Pizza

Clarke F,40.0,"Ike's is always fun for unique sandwiches, though just prepare for a heavy lunch.  Most recently I tried the Robin Williams which was delicious, and also I had the Kryptonite for the first time in years.  Even a half of a Kryptonite is easily big...enough for multiple meals.  What I love about this place is the upbeat, helpful staff.  They are willing to customize things, and make a busy frenetic place feel laid back.  My one gripe, which can be a major one if you come out of your way to get a specific sandwich like I did, is that they run out of ingredients for their specialty subs (even early in the day), which can be a bummer as these subs are only offered one day a week, so if you want a specific sandwich you have to plan a visit on a certain day.More",October 2018,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60713-d1063776-Reviews-Ike_s_Love_Sandwiches-San_Francisco_California.html

wubbuwu,40.0,"Ate here before a 6:35pm weeknight opera (we got here about 5:40).  The neighborhood restaurants are all packed, but this funky little gem had no line.  
I got the Hawaiian bugger, hubby got wings.  Burger wasn't huge in diameter, didn't fill the bun by about...1/4"" all the way around.  But it was thick, juicy, tasty, and well prepared.  Next time I'll just go with a straight cheeseburger, don't think it needs anything else.  Burger comes with fries, and there were a decent amount of them (think medium McDonalds amount).  They're really good.  Hubby said his wings were good.  
Seating is mostly upstairs.  It's not comfy (flat wood benches), but you're no there that long. 
Only downside is that it took quite a while for the food to arrive.  So we had to eat quickly.

mzdov,40.0,"Cute little burger place that a friend of mine took me to while I was in town. Since he's a vegetarian, I'm assuming he got a veggie burger, but looking at the menu online, I don't see that as an option. I ordered the original...burger with cheddar. The burgers come with fries, well kind of. First, the burger. Your classic burger. Nothing fancy, but taste wise it was delicious. Huge patty. Hangs a little over the edge of the bun. Cooked perfectly. The fries that come with are good, but you literally get 15 fries if you're lucky. For the $8.95 price, that's a bit of a bummer. We also got an order of onion rings. Very tasty as well, but again, we got all of 5 onion rings for $3.95. Overall, service was good, food was good.

The crab and cellophane noodles ALWAYS have pieces of crab shell -- this to me is lazy. 

The presentation is also sloppy -- if the cilantro is more than a garnish, PLEASE take the leaves off. This is something I do if I make food for myself at home, no one wants to eat cilantro stems. No one.

The food here is excellent....I tried the sandwiches and the curries and loved everything I ate. Some may find it overpriced but it is incredibly filling. No real need to order side dishes as you get more than enough. I recommend the lemonade also, homemade. 

The staff are polite and friendly and the food is amazing. Go here after a film or inbetween films or shopping as you get served really quickly the food comes out within five minutes.

The food options are pretty good - sandwiches, apps, soup, hot entree options, even lots of dessert options!

The first day I ordered white rice with eggplant, noodles, and lemongrass tofu. It was all pretty good but the eggplant was just ehh to me but overall good. Nothing amazing but good. If you read my other reviews, you might notice by now that I love eggplant dishes lol.

The second day I ordered spicy pho and it was okay. It could've been better in terms or flavor but it wasn't awful. I still ate the whole dish lol. 

Everything was overpriced, probably because it's in downtown SF, but literally it was way too expensive for what you get. I didn't feel this way at all about the LH in LA. Also, their customer service is not great. They rush you and barely let you finish talking as you try to explain your order. Sure, it's busy, but relax...they stress themselves out more than we stress them out. I felt overwhelmed and flustered because they were in such a rush - I felt like I was running out of time or something. 

Granted, it's a food court...expectations aren't exactly high to begin with. Food is good, I'd go again if I have to be in the area and can't make it in time anywhere else outside of Westfield Mall. Also, I love supporting vegan companies. However, if I can spend less or the same somewhere else with better service and more bang for my buck, I most definitely will.More",September 2018,Loving Hut

SwingerJ,30.0,"Don't be fooled by the name ""Prada""...this pizza has nothing to do with the overpriced high end fashion brand.  

San Francisco is not Vegas, the bars generally stopping serving alcohol at around 1:30am, or for you older folks like me just after midnight is quitting...time.  This is where Pizza Prada comes in...this mediocre tasteless pizza is pure drunk food to soak up that all unnecessary but super fun alcohol you've been destroying your liver with all night long. $6 is certainly excessive for a slice of this uninspiring flavorless pizza, but still worth it to prevent you from later puking out that overpriced San Francisco dinner you ate a few hours  ago, and minimizing the pain and agony of the inevitable hangover to come when the dawn arrives.  That thick white bread dough will soak up the booze while the heavy mozzarella cheese prevents the possibility of nasty diarrhea. 

By my calculations, you sober folks will think I'm way too generous for giving Pizza Prada a 3 star review, but my lack of a massive headache earlier this Sunday morning gives this joint an extra 2 stars.  Better than modern western medicine...bon appetit, you drunks!More",March 2018,Pizza Prada

Just a little joint,...a counter guy, cheery as all get out, and a grill cook. Went for the classic cheeseburger lunch (a salad bar offers condiments and add-ons) and sodas. The burger was excellent cooked to medium juicy perfection. The fries were really hot and really tasted like potatoes. Couldn't have been happier. And then it was just a couple block stroll back to our room.

A digression: because our route took us down Polk, we walked by a small street that has been transformed into art. Fern Street. Colors, circles and quotations. It was SUCH a surprise and such a delight!More",May 2019,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60713-d480155-Reviews-Slider_s_Diner-San_Francisco_California.html

MaizieAnn,50.0,"Stopped in with a friend on 9/8/18 late in the afternoon and ordered the hot links and a chili cheese dog, fries and milk shakes.   The food was delicious and the staff even better!  The manager (owner?), cooks and counter staff all got involved in...serving us.  They will understand why my heart is full of love for them.  Every one of them, even the cooks, showed their compassion and humanity in the most beautiful way.  They treated us like family (the beloved relatives, not the other kind).  Their manager's actions were mirrored by his staff, for which we were grateful and quite humbled.

The food was served hot and tasty.   My chili cheese dog was filled with homemade chili, topped with Velveeta based cheese sause.  The beans were tender but not mushy, and the hot dog was done perfectly.  My chocolate milkshake was entirely different than the usual, pale fast food shakes that barely taste like chocolate.  This one was a rich, chocolatey color and full-flavored.  Yummy!  The hot links were spicy and tasted great according to my friend, a Louisiana native who knows good food.  I didn't try them because I am a wimp, and the word ""Hot"" in hot links is enough to scare me off, and leave those foods to the professionals.  I will gladly go back and eat there again.

764danio,50.0,"I had such an exciting discovery yesterday at the Golden Gate Meat Company in the ferry building.... Emmer + Co. chickens! I love the Golden Gate Meat Company because they have an amazing variety and really care about offering fantastic products. Dean, who I trust...with all things meat, gave his stamp of approval for the Emmer chicken. The CEO & Farmer of Emmer (Jesse) was hanging out to answer questions about his birds. They are 100% pasture raised meaning they really live outside. The conditions inside his mobile, solar powered (!) houses are great for the birds to sleep and stay safe through the night. And he moves the houses through the pasture so each new flocks gets fresh grass to eat and pasture on. The regenerative practices are good for the environment and the birds. Jesse taught us all of this and showed us photos of the farm and practices. The farm is in Green Valley just north of the city, so it’s super local.
We roasted our chicken last night and WOW!! So juicy, tender, and delicious. More flavor without compromising the texture. Definitely make a point of trying this chicken. I’m getting these chickens from now on! It’s nice to feel good about the meat you eat.More",June 2019,Golden Gate Meat Company

Kurt S,30.0,"Used Bart to get from SFO to downtown.  It was $8.25 per person each way.  Cab ride is about $45, so do the math.  If you're a party of five, just take the cab.  Bart is what it is -- a pretty tired looking, grungy...experience.  Some clown at SFO jumped on our car as we pulled out of the airport begging for money because ""his daughter had to pay extra baggage fee"".  It was BS and just typical of the homeless situation around SF.  He was loud and there was no police anywhere in sight.  Thankfully, he just moved on after a while, but he did fleece several bucks off several people.  30 minutes each way.  Lot of stops.  It's an interesting way to get to the city and fairly cheap if you're party is SMALL.More",April 2013,Subway

dapper777,30.0,"Restaurants are very expensive in San Francisco.
If you do not want to waste time and money searching for some dececent and reasonably priced food, Panda Express is an option, downtown.
There is no better place to eat... the Westfield Center.
We went there around...6:30pm and the mall was very crowded.
That's maybe a good time to try it : they are very  busy. The high turnover and  fresher entrees make a big difference in taste. 
We got brown rice, noodles,their orange chicken and mixed vegetables.
It was nice. It was tasty.
It was fast  And not expensive.
Eventually you will have some problems in finding a table and some chairs.
And occasionally be bothered by some poor homeless people.
This joint at Westfield Mall really cooks the best in town in our opinion.

Steven C,40.0,"Our favorite pizza place in the Castro has changed owners, and we heard it is not what it used to be, so we tried nearby Marcello's, which we heard great things about.  Nice friendly atmosphere, real New York style, selling by the large slice of...pies fresh out of the oven.  
They have got the crust nailed- crispy on the bottom, then chewy, with a nice airy rim around the edge.  They also have all the accessories- grated parmesan, powdered garlic, oregano (okay, that's not so much a NY thing) and crushed red peppers.
Where they fall down is the toppings. The cheese was not nearly gooey and stretchy enough, and the sauce, rather than having a good tomato tang, was on the sweet side.  Not, what you would find in New York.
Our first slices were warm, not hot, although my second slice was nice and hot.
Reasonably priced at around $5 per large slice, and they had a couple of good beers available.

You pick either a pita sandwich, a salad bowl or _____ (can't remember the 3rd option;...we all chose Pita Sandwich.

Excellent pita bread, nicely flavored and warm from the oven.  A small bit of humus spread in the pocket then falafel and veggies and stuff layered into the pocket till it was stuffed.  You can choose all veggie (I did) or Schwarma Chicken or Beef or a veggie-meat combo).  They kind of build the sandwich from the bottom of the pocket up, and make it a double layer, so that as you eat from the top down, you effectively get a double serving.  Two of us ordered the 'double veggie', one the veggie - chicken combo.  We all agreed the full veggie was the way to go.

It was our 1st visit, and the people were Very Helpful and friendly, explaining the process and the options.  There are the usual canned soft drinks and a Very Tasty Mango Lemonade (I had that).  There are also two additional (free) sauces and some pickled carrots, cauliflower pieces and onion you can add to your sandwich.

We ate outside enjoying the perfect weather; there are also a few tables inside.More",October 2016,Sababa

The pita is extra for $1 and made fresh in front of you.

Pizza was not great at all, which sucked because it looked beautiful, but looks aren’t everything. All the veggies on the pizza were watery and gross, they tasted like they had been sitting in water or frozen, the sausage on the pizza was completely burned, and the tomato sauce tasted like it was base unseasoned Ragu. We had also ordered wings which also tasted like they had been frozen, and then baked for too long as the chicken was completely burned into the aluminum foil. We couldn’t and didn’t want to try to eat the wings, and by this time it was well past 2:00 am and with nothing else being open we just went ahead and ate a few slices of pizza, and tossed the rest, it was such a bad waste of food, and energy.

I ordered...a pepperoni slice but they gave me a pepperoni with sausage and I didn't care enough to ask them to change it. I'd guess that they would have changed it if I complained. That slice was barely warm (a problem I saw listed in another review). I got a slice of the chicken pesto as well and it was warmer.

I should have unpacked every item right there! Back at the hotel, I realized that I paid for five items and got only four. In addition, my food was not what I ordered.

After taking a bite of my burrito, I put it down, went outside, and...offered to treat him to a meal. He chose to remain outside, so I ordered for him and brought his burrito outside to him. Suddenly, I heard my (normally mild-mannered) husband shouting angrily. Someone had reached through the opening, grabbed my burrito, and run off. (The beggar I was talking with was horrified, thinking it was my little girl's food that had been stolen. He offered me his untouched burrito, which I declined.)

I don't hold this against the restaurant. I didn't report it to management, as I had already kept my family waiting long enough and my husband shared his burrito with me.

They had no more chicken, no more mild salsa, and...no more smile or good service either. The beef I had instead of the chicken I would’ve liked was chewy, and the whole ""salad""  was mushy and heavy, having nothing to do with the good and fresh one I had two days ago. 

My man was not impressed at all, and I was embarrassed I had told him that place was good. 

The cherry on the cake: at some point they cranked up the volume of the music so loud we could not hear each other. Think you work in a bar, dudes?

wkrupa,20.0,"I’m not sure how a restaurant gets awards out here in California because clearly awards are meaningless. Walking into a not really clean establishment ordering, then sitting down to wait for your food gets it started. You sit there pondering why there are fruit flies...in the air, then you realize having an open food scrap garbage can inside the eating area could be the reason. I had bbq wings, which came underdone. Then only a firehouse burger medium rare, which was basically just beyond rare, along with very few of the fixings that were listed on the menu. Add frozen fries to the list and it just showed whoever gave this burger place an award must have dead tastebuds.More",April 2018,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60713-d446784-Reviews-BurgerMeister-San_Francisco_California.html

Scruff_UK,20.0,"I wouldn't normally even consider writing a review for a Subway restaurant. It's one up from reviewing McDonald's. But after the experience my wife & I had here, I felt compelled to write about it.

We went at 10.30 on a Monday morning to pick...up some sandwiches prior to going to the zoo. It should be straightforward enough to buy sandwiches at 10.30 in the morning; we were the only two people in there aside from the woman serving and two homeless people lying on the seats. If you've ever been to Subway, you know how long it takes to make a couple of different sandwiches. Imagine how awkward that is when there's a homeless woman sat a few feet away from you constantly yelling at you to buy her some chips, and the server gives only a half-hearted ""Stop bothering the customers"".

The second star is for the sandwiches, which were nice enough.More",August 2014,Subway

Elnora C,30.0,"In town for a meeting and only an hour for lunch?  You could try Muracci's Japanese Curry and Grill. It's mobbed at lunch - you squeeze into this small space and give your order to a waitress walking around.  Then you wait on the sidewalk...with 2 dozen other people.  It won't be fast, so if you really have less than an hour, try calling in your order ahead of time.  

There's a few things I don't get about this place. They are:

1.  Why does a Japanese place have a name that sounds Italian?
2.  Since it is popular and a lot of people go for lunch, why don't they have all the curries already made and packaged ready to just hand out?  Why do you have to wait about 20-30 minutes?
3.  Why is it so popular?  It is  decent but not great food.

IntrepidFeline,40.0,"Muracci's serves up a very flavorful curry sauce of customer selectable levels of spiciness. I went with the medium which was about what I expected. The curry is delicious with a deep flavor profile. It went well with the optional brown rice. There was also...a pinch of pickled vegetables, okay tasting. 

The main issue with the grilled chicken curry, is that there isn't much chicken in the curry. I don't know but I'll guess one boneless thigh? Could have doubled the meat and it would still be on the light side. 

The other beef is that there's no vegetables. Could offer a side of broccoli, asparagus, or something.

I'm going to presume that this is how they serve curry in Japan, and they are staying true to their roots. So I'll rate the food I did get versus focusing on the food I didn't.

The food is delicious so I would recommend it for lunch or a light dinner.More",May 2016,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60713-d3613017-Reviews-Muracci_s_Japanese_Curry_Grill-San_Francisco_California.html

The_Loup_Garou,20.0,"Not Like It Used to Be

We have stayed at the Taj Campton Hotel, on Stockton St, many times. In October, we were back, and I headed up to the end of the block, at Sutter, to the Starbucks on the corner (390 Stockton), to...get a Pumpkin-spiced Latte. Though our hotel had coffee in the room, and the lobby, about October, Starbucks brings out that particular Latte, which I really enjoy. I had done the same for many of our Autumn trips.

Now, this Starbucks is just off of Union Square, by two blocks, and then only a few blocks from Chinatown, so it is not out in the suburbs - it’s right in downtown. Once, it was the hang out of lots of young folk, working on their laptops, and devices, sipping coffee. However, on this visit, it was a totally different story.

Where this shop was once very clean, it looked like it could now use a high-pressure washing. Gone were the folk with their devices, and their bluetooth ear buds, and now, it looked more like a homeless encampment. It had deteriorated, and drastically.

Instead of sitting on a stool, and sipping the Latte, I capped it, and headed back to my hotel room. I just was not interested in drinking coffee in that place, and will likely not even bother visiting there again.More",October 2019,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60713-d6564767-Reviews-Starbucks-San_Francisco_California.html

Zjavid,10.0,"This restaurant upheld MealPal's reputation as a subpar service for consumers (albeit an efficient way for restaurants to dispose of old food).

I ordered a beef paleo bowl. The ingredients include roasted cauliflower rice, braised greens and pickled red onions. The meat was fatty and discolored. The rest of the ingredients were mushy, congealed, drowned in saturated fat (not even olive oil, likely some bootleg canola oil) and definitely not fresh.

The restaurant also appeared to lag in the sanitation department. I don't recall their grade by public health, but I would be surprised if it was above a B.

I usually peel off a lot of bread from sandwiches but this bread was toasted and seasoned to perfection and I ate every bite of it also. The next time we're at the ferry building we are definitely coming back here. They cook up your items when you order so they are freshly made. Hence you have to wait a few minutes.

andrewlibson,30.0,"I am not sure how to review this pizza.

I like thicker crust pizza that has more cheese.  Arinell Pizza is really thin slice pizza with just a thin layer of crust, of sauce and of cheese.  A slice of cheese is $3 and a...slice and if you add an ingredient its $3.50.  So I would say you will really like this pizza if you like the thin slice, but for me I like the NY slice that has the thin crust but has a large quantity of cheese..so I am not as fond of this sort of pizza . (and thus average rating)

They do also have a thick slice which seems to have more cheese, but while I like the heavy cheese, it has too much dough for my liking.

If you like this kind of pizza, I think you will find it 'Very good' or ""excellent"".  

There is not a lot of space inside and no tables (just counter space on the side walls) but its good for a 'to go' slice.

So...if you like this sort of thin slice NY style pizza (or just need a quick snack) then I think this place is worth checking out.More",June 2017,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60713-d360032-Reviews-Arinell_Pizza-San_Francisco_California.html

The food is OK, but not any better - it sits out in steamer trays so not always hot or fresh.  And there is real variation among the servers.  Some realize you're paying sit-down restaurant prices and give you a decent portion.  Others are just getting through the backlog of waiting customers and spoon a small amount of food into the bowl, leaving it half full at the end.  Unacceptable.

JAY M,40.0,"This place is insanely crowded during lunch hours, so in case you're not having a time constraint, you can check it out before or after those hours. 

Food:
Bamboo Asia has three options as far as the cuisine goes - Indian, Vietnamese and Japanese. I...have tried Vietnamese and Indian rice bowls and loved it. They have a large variety of options on what you want to add to your bowls in terms of choice of rice, proteins, veggies, sauces and toppings. So, essentially, you have a good amount of control on what you are eating. One can also make out that the ingredients are fresh, partly also because of good churn. 

Ambiance: 
If you're visiting this place in the noon hours, expect it to be really cramped and be ready for long queues on any counter you visit. It is not a fine dining restaurant and most of the people go for a take away but there are good number of seating options in case you want to have your meal there itself. In non-rush hours, the place is quite spacious and the glass wall ensures enough natural light. 

Service: 
They are quite quick in terms of turnaround time for customers. It is not a fine dining restaurant but has more of a subway style set up where you just tell them what you want to add in your salad/rice bowl or sandwich and they'll add that. The staff is good and helpful. 

Overall, it is a very good restaurant that people must try at least once or twice.More",May 2016,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60713-d2205328-Reviews-BAMBOO_Asia-San_Francisco_California.html

stardustbay,40.0,"Bamboo Asia is a fusion diner offering three different types of ‘Asian’ cuisine - Japanese, Indian and Vietnamese. Its a canteen-like setting whereby they have 3 different counters with prepared food in bain maries and once you walk in, you decide what kind of food...you fancy and queue up respectively. There are 3 distinct meals to pick…salad, bowl or a 'wrap'. The wrap differs depending which cuisine you pick. Indian one is a burrito like wrap which they call 'Roti'. Vietnamese is a sandwich and Japanese is sushi.

The first time we went, we tried the Japanese ‘Bambuddha' which is a salad bowl. The ingredients seemed freshly prepared and the chef behind the counter could surely cut up an avocado beautifully. There was a mixture of healthy ingredients... tofu, cucumber, mushrooms, seaweed, etc which were all well put together and it just tasted nice and refreshing.
We also tried the Indian ‘Holy Cow' which consisted of many interesting sounding ingredients. Its basically like a curry but in a buritto wrap.The raisins added a perfect touch and balance to the savoury ingredients and it tasted absolutely amazing. Thats why we went back to try the Vietnamese.

We got Shaking Beef Curry from the Viet counter. When my partner ordered his, I had a taste of the beef first to see if its to my liking (as I am rather picky to how beef is done) and it tasted really tender and succulent so I went ahead to order mine. However, they had just ran out of beef and were doing a new batch. Great, I thought... fresh meat! Unfortunately, I'm afraid to say that mine didn't taste half as good as my partner's. The beef was really chewy and tough with slight pink in the middle and didn't taste nice unlike my partners beautifully browned and juicy version. I think the reason behind this was because it hadn't had time to sit in the juices and soak the flavours. Either that or they cooked the batch wrong. I also made the mistake of having it with rice noodles instead of brown rice. The noodles were cold and wasn't very tasty. I felt my dish lacked sauce. 
I was very disappointed with this but I didn't complain as I was very happy with the other meals we had tried and would definitely go back for. Just not the Shaking Beef Curry!More",April 2014,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60713-d2205328-Reviews-BAMBOO_Asia-San_Francisco_California.html

The burger was big, tasty and hit the spot ! They use Nieman's meat, always a good thing. I didn't hear a word from him. The Hot dog was a big disappointment. It came flat as a pancake, as they cut it in half length wise and they offer minimal choices for toppings. The only good thing, it was grilled to a nice crisp perfection. Too bad the hot dog wasn't a tad bit thicker, too bad their wasn't any relish or other condiments offered. That being said I will come back for the Hamburger :)More",January 2017,Beep's Burgers

1-spidermonkey-1,30.0,"Some facts... I went here three nights in a row (M-W) to take advantage of the HH specials ($3 pizza--pepperoni and cheese only, and $3 beers-any).  All three nights I had ordered 2 of each for $12.  The first night was dead--I think only three...ppl came in the 40 mins I visited.  The 2nd night about 20 ppl came through, but was heavily weighted to men only, as others have noted on Yelp.   The 3rd night was different, very busy (~40ppl) and much more weighted towards women.  My take on this after 3 consecutive nights... this is a place to visit for the beer before your next stop--whatever that is.  For me it was watching soccer back at the hotel.  The Racer 5 IPA was very, very good at $3/pt.  The $3/slice was like food court pizza but not bad *with* the beer.  Beer first, pizza an afterthought.

We forgot to ask for them rare and when I remembered to ask they were already cooked, medium.  I, for one, cannot eat hamburger any more cooked than medium rare, but I gave it a go.  It was actually really good.  They char broil them and the sauces or whatever they put on besides the mushrooms and cheese was delicious.  It was served on a brioche bun which was fresh and good.  We opted for the house made chips as they were just made that morning and they did not disappoint.  It's a greal little place for burgers and salads seemed to be popular too.

Lia T,40.0,"While ""regular"" burgers are available here, there are also choices such as bison, lamb, and duck duck goose (duck patty, duck bacon, goose pate). I wanted to try this duck one, but they said they were out! So I had the bison. I would say...the bison was okay to good, but with the sweet, flavorful ripe red tomato slice, the flavors together were fabulous. Also, with out the tomato, I think my burger would have been rather dry as bison is lower in fat than beef. I liked my meal enough to want to go back and try something else, like the duck burger.
The place makes their own potato chips, which are on the dark side and very crunchy. I did not really like them, didn't seem to have much flavor, and looked very oily. Tried the sweet potato tater tots, didn't care for them. Not crispy enough for me, and then they were soft and mush inside.  I think they would be good to take home and crisp up in the oven, though.

The signage was cool as was the Dinosaurs logo and my husband got the ""special"" banh mi and I got the sliced pork. I was disappointed because about half the meat in my sandwich was way too chewy and all fat but the parts of the pork that were edible were good and flavorful with the spices as was the rest of the sandwich and texture of the baguette.

The falafel was as big as a super burrito, so it plus the 2 sides were plenty for us.  The 2 sides we ordered were hummus and the taboun salad.  The hummus was the best I have ever had, and the salad was a delightful greek salad of tomato, cucumber, feta cheese, etc, and a very nice dressing.  They have a dispenser for free water which is what we chose.  The floating cucumbers inside the dispenser were unexpected, but made a very refreshing drink.

The_Loup_Garou,40.0,"Herb & Kitchen is a combo of a deli, a convenience store, and a pizzaria, in the lobby of the San Francisco Hilton Union Square. The concept (under a few different names), has become popular at Hiltons in the USA. Some are larger than others,...and this is the largest, most diverse, which I have seen, but given the size of this hotel, it’s very understandable.

Hilton began phasing out traditional room service, some years ago, and Herb & Kitchen is an adequate replacement - though rather than a cart arriving at one’s room door, with domed plates (always a nice presentation), one just grabs what they want, and head to the room, or to one of the many tables near the entrance, or around the lobby.

On this March visit, I was just picking up some Ginger Ale for the room, and have to say that Herb & Kitchen is about as convenient, as it gets. Now, one does pay a bit for that convenience, but in a city, such as San Francisco, finding a grocery store, in the heart of Union Square - well, it would be virtually impossible, so Herb & Kitchen proved very useful, and I did not mind paying a little bit of a premium for my soda. I was quickly checked-out, and on my way to the elevators in Tower 1, in moments - does not get more convenient than that. Oh, and the pizza certainly smelled good - maybe next visit?

On this day, with a fairly large convention in the hotel, I was glad that I did not need to find a table, as all were taken, including the seats at the lobby bar, which had not yet opened for the afternoon.

A nice concept, and a very nice store, right in the lobby of the San Francisco Hilton Union Square.More",March 2019,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60713-d12826170-Reviews-Herb_N_Kitchen-San_Francisco_California.html

We sat at our table (felt like a cafeteria or a food court, sort of), and had our lunch. It's not place for ambiance or anything, but it filled us up and the food was pretty good.

Pizza Orgasmica used to inhabit this space. but when I finally dropped in, they appeared to have been replaced by Gochee's...or maybe it's Pizza Orgasmica under a new name. Okay...pizza, acceptable house wine (though $8 a glass).

DanW440,50.0,I spotted this very special shop while on a Chinatown walking tour and returned after dinner. What a unique and interesting place to have an unusual dessert like no other. It’s a bit pricey but one dish is plenty for two people. They offer a...large variety of flavors and toppings.

Bad_Seed4,40.0,"This place is in Chinatown and they make the ice cream in front of you in something like a crepe machine. It’s rolled up into rolls and then various toppings are added. It’s not the cheapest but one portion is plenty big enough for two....Because it’s quite labour intensive, I imagine it could get pretty busy at times although service was good when we went. It’s a bit tricky to eat but that’s part of the fun.

morganleprix,30.0,"Service is severely lacking at this outlet of the popular chain. Though the food is as expected, having to fetch my own drink and sweet goods for an online order is not required in other outlets - it is all available for collection at the...counter collection point. Surly advice of this approach.

Recommend their take 2 which is a half portion of 2 different items - i.e soup and sandwich or similar. Great baked goods on a clear display. If you want to customise, always better to order on line for pick up or use the screens on site. Staff will normally help if anything is unclear (though this store may be not!)

Go to the outlet next to the Caltrain depot across town - much better service there.More",September 2015,Panera Bread

Steven B,20.0,"Tried this new place, not great. They only have vanilla.  It's the consistency of soft serve yogurt but has no flavor. I suppose you are supposed to get a topping.  Seems like it's designed more like an quickly than an ice cream place. $5 for...a cup, not a bargain either.  Its a Chinese/ Taiwan chain if you check the website, so in tradition with that you will find not a very sweet flavor with non traditional toppings.  Walk an extra block to the San Francisco Hometown Creamery for some good ice cream.More",September 2016,Honey Creme

The pastries are scrumptious. I especially loved the chocolate croissant with a hint of orange marmalade... delicious! The...savory cheddar chipotle biscuit is melt in your mouth good. 
I also came at lunch one day and tried one of their specialties, the Moroccan lamb sandwich with homemade harissa sauce. It was so, so tasty. I topped it all off with a chocolate chip cookie with just a hint of sea salt which was just the perfect touch. They have beer and wine which is a nice bonus as well. 
All of the staff seemed friendly and easygoing.More",August 2017,L'acajou Bakery & Cafe
staceykim4695,50.0,"Such a cute bakery in San Francisco. I was in SF for the first time for two weeks for some interviews, and I came here for lunch almost everyday. 

Service:
Great service! All the workers are super friendly and sweet. They always ask me how...my day's going, and it always brightens up my day when I come in for a cup of coffee!

Food:
They have a great selection of sandwiches and salads. 

I've had the:
*Pulled Moroccan Lamb Sandwich
*Avocado Toast
*Quinoa Bowl
*Baked Goods

Pulled Moroccan Lamb Sandwich has a nice spicy kick to it, which is great because I love spice, but it's not spicy to the point where you want to cut your tongue off. They serve it with a homemade slaw that complements the lamb really well. The bread is also really fluffy and nicely toasted. 

The Avocado Toast is surprisingly very good. I expected a generic avocado toast when i ordered it, but theirs had so much flavor! It came with an orange colored sauce, cheese, bacon and their homemade slaw.

I always ordered chicken, spinach, roasted tomatoes, and avocado in my quinoa bowls with balsamic vinaigrette. It was pretty decent; wish they would add a bit more items, but it was tasty!

Definitely try their baked goods, which are made in house! I LOVE the banana bread, so moist and just the right amount of sweetness! Can't go wrong with their cookies either. Will have to try their other baked goods if I'm ever back in the area again.

Coffee:
I'm not a huge coffee aficionado, but their coffee is good and always freshly brewed. I always got their regular drip coffee or cold brew.

Atmosphere:
It's a bit small, but hey, it's SF. I was still able to find seats, and they have outdoor seating too. Decorated cutely. Always love the music they put on. Loved seeing all the workers jamming to it every day :)

Overall, love this bakery/cafe and if I'm ever in the SF area again, will definitely visit. The items are a bit pricey but not much different from other places in SF, and I just learned that the owner pays his workers a livable wage, which is why the prices are a bit high. Always onboard for businesses who are looking out for their employees. Definitely was a place of warmth for me, while stressing out over interviews. Can't wait to come again!More",August 2017,L'acajou Bakery & Cafe
Calvin G,50.0,"If I could give this place 6 stars, I would simply because of the turmeric monkey bread! Don't walk, RUN to get some before it sells out. Or better yet, order online the night before and reserve so you are 100% sure you will get...some :)More",December 2020,Vive La Tarte

More tasty than the other places we went before even it was great spots.
Some details make the difference : the seasonings, eggs very well cooked, quality of Bread home made. 
The tea is also very good and most of it, the pain au chocolat is one of the best we ever had. And trust me, as a French, we know about it ;) Bravo!

Iqbal K,10.0,"Ordered Shawarma, Calzone and harissa. The Front page of the Flyer says that it is Mediterranean Food, nothing else indicating the origin or what to expect. Upon delivery, most of the food was just ok on the average side, however, harissa (dessert) was not what...I expected. Harrisa is usually made with vermicelli. What they delivered felt like Corn Bread soaked in honey. When I called to inquire, the owner said this is not Arabic Harissa but a Turkish. The flyer does not say its Turkish food. The owner likes to argue and would not listen to the customer.

Murat B,30.0,"This is predominantly a takeout place on Polk Street but they also have a few tables if you want to sit and have a quick bite. We decided to check this place out because it was within walking distance to our hotel and they said...their shawarma was excellent. Maybe it's because we're from Turkey where doner kebab and durum are easily the best of the best in my opinion, but I found their food average and the service kind of slow even though we were the only customers inside. The guy at the counter told me the staff were mainly from Algeria and the owner was from Yemen and they only served halal food. I found, besides pizza, most of the food they were selling were variations of Turkish food with different sauces and spices. Not a place I'd particularly recommend but still not bad for a quick bite if you're really hungry.More",February 2017,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60713-d2483479-Reviews-Fresco_Pizza_and_Shawarma-San_Francisco_California.html

Baxter451,30.0,"Was intrigued by the name - Pizza and Shawarma – a bit of an odd coupling.  Place was deserted when I walked in at midday – had to wait for the cook to come out from the back.  Had the chicken shawarma (“spicy”).  Large and...tasty, with just a touch of heat.  Price was a bit on the high side.  Pizza didn’t look too exciting, but Mediterranean salads in the cold case looked good.
